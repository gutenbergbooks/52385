<h1 title="">DICK KENT WITH THE
<br />MALEMUTE MAIL</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">A CREEPING MENACE</span></h2>
<p>A discouraged, dishevelled human figure crossed
a narrow woodland to the west of a chain of hills,
thence made his way slowly down to a sun-baked
valley or depression, many miles in extent. The valley
was rough, broken, repellent to the eye. For the
most part unverdant, it ran in a northeasterly direction&mdash;bleak,
uninviting, monotonous&mdash;here and there
rutted with long gray drifts of silt and sand.</p>
<p>No trail of any sort traversed that sinister, malevolent
wild. Except for an occasional poplar or
charred, broken stump of spruce or jack-pine, there
were few landmarks to relieve the discouraging prospect.
However, at one end of the valley, scintillating
like a silver coin in the bright rays of the sun, the
traveller discerned a small lake, fringed with green.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>In the center of the narrow green strip, on one
side of the lake, stood the cabin of a prospector. The
traveller regarded it impassively for a moment before
he went on.</p>
<p>Still hours high, the sun struck its bright rays
across the land: a glare of white in the somnolent
valley, a sheen of mirrored brilliance where it radiated
over the placid, blue waters of the lake. A
deep hush had fallen over the earth. Below the wide,
azure arch of the sky feathered voyagers of the air
coasted silently to unknown haunts, apparently the
only living things in the dead gray world around
them.</p>
<p>The figure hurried on. The sight of the cabin had
acted as a slight spur to his jaded body. He pushed
forward steadily until he had made his way over the
narrow strip of green and up the path to the house.
He knocked listlessly at the door, then stood silently,
as might a criminal awaiting the heavy hand of the
law.</p>
<p>A half-breed admitted him, white teeth shining in
an expansive welcoming grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Meester Davis. By Gar!&mdash;et ees good.
You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An old man hobbled excitedly across the room, his
long white beard flaring out in the sudden breeze
from the doorway. His palsied, rheumatic hands
crept up slowly to the younger man&rsquo;s shoulders and
remained there for a moment in silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;Davis,&rdquo; he declared simply, &ldquo;you are welcome
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wan smile parted the other&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you again, Mr. Harbinson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man motioned to a rough, worn bench.
&ldquo;Sit down, man, sit down. You must be tired.&rdquo; He
turned to the half-breed. &ldquo;Baptiste, hurry something
to eat for Mr. Davis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the preparations for the meal were proceeding,
the old man talked steadily. Presently Davis,
unable longer to postpone the ordeal, face red with
humiliation, blurted out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harbinson, I did not succeed in my mission.
I have failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Failed!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Davis rose from his seat, voice quavering,
&ldquo;yes, I can see no hope for us. The doctor was gone.
I got nothing. Nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gloomily he paced back and forth across the rough
floor of the sparsely furnished room. The eyes of
the white prospector and the half-breed followed him
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid of that,&rdquo; Harbinson declared presently,
&ldquo;I knew you had a chance of missing him. It
is a terrible thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davis stopped short in the middle of his nervous
pacing and raised one arm in a hopeless gesture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even if I&rsquo;d seen him, it might have done us no
good. The entire north country is undermined with
the thing, especially among the Indians. It&rsquo;s working
gradually south. The missions are filled to overflowing.&rdquo;
His voice lowered to a husky whisper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
awful, Harbinson. Awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man gazed dully at his partner through a
long interval of silence. Davis spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I left here two weeks ago, has there been
any new development?&rdquo; He looked searchingly at the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s reached the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only ten miles away,&rdquo; Davis calculated
roughly. &ldquo;How did you find this out? Send Baptiste?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Pierre La Lond passed here two days ago
and told us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t let him in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harbinson evaded the other&rsquo;s eyes. Baptiste, advancing
to the table with a steaming kettle swinging
from one hand, stopped short and shot a questioning
gaze at the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I couldn&rsquo;t stop him. We were busy at something.
He opened the door and walked in. It was
too late then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unfortunate,&rdquo; Davis scowled. &ldquo;He should
have known better.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what am I to do? Sooner or later, we&rsquo;ll be
exposed. We can&rsquo;t always be isolated. Another
thing, we&rsquo;ll soon need more supplies. Our grubstake&rsquo;s
getting low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the post thirty miles south of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Closed up,&rdquo; said Harbinson briefly. &ldquo;La Lond
told us that too. Won&rsquo;t be able to get any supplies
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll live on a meat diet then,&rdquo; Davis declared
grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scurvy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s much better than the horror of this other
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harbinson did not reply. Stillness fell over the
room again. Davis resumed his seat on the rough
bench and sat with his head in his hands until Baptiste
announced that the meal was ready. As he
ate, the young prospector could hear Harbinson&rsquo;s
asthmatic breathing and the scraping of the half-breed&rsquo;s
moccasined feet across the floor.</p>
<p>Hungry though he had been, he had little taste
for food. His mind was too much upset. The disappointing
news he had brought back to his partner,
he well knew had been a heavy blow indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Later, the three men walked outside, seeking the
warm sunshine that fell aslant across the land. The
lake still shimmered under the bright glare. A few
birds winged their way across the sky. Desolate
at all times, the sleepy valley now held no trace of
life anywhere. Off to the westward the hills and
rocks formed a dun labyrinth, and from the crest of
the nearest slope one looked down over heights and
depths, broken ridges, crooked valleys&mdash;all pervaded,
choked with an awful solitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; croaked the old prospector finally, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
to be done? We&rsquo;ve not only ourselves to think about&mdash;but
others. It&rsquo;s late in the fall now. By spring
there won&rsquo;t be a single soul north of the Mackenzie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davis studied the problem, as he had done almost
continually since he had left Fort Garrison a week
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one thing we can do,&rdquo; he answered quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notify the police. It&rsquo;s our only hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought about that,&rdquo; said Harbinson
brightening. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d go to the Mackenzie River
Barracks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll carry the news there. It will be much
quicker than to wait for their regular patrol. I know
Inspector Cameron. He&rsquo;ll act promptly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate to see you start out again, Davis, so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped. I&rsquo;ll leave in the morning. But
this time, Harbinson, let me warn you. Keep everybody
away. Do you hear? Nobody must come here.
If necessary, enforce this rule at the point of a gun.
But enforce it you must.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The hands of the old prospector were shaking.
He thrust them in his pockets to hide the fact from
his partner. But he could not conceal from the
other&rsquo;s inquiring gaze the flush that flooded his
cheeks, the unearthly sparkle of his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not feeling well,&rdquo; accused the younger
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! I&rsquo;m all right. Don&rsquo;t think that,&rdquo;
quavered Harbinson. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man, apparently, believed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the worry, I suppose. But forget it, Charley.
We&rsquo;ll beat this thing yet. Inspector Cameron will
see the necessity of doing something at once. You
can always rely on the mounted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the remainder of the day nothing more was
said on the subject. Baptiste and the younger man
busied themselves about the place, while Harbinson
retired to his bunk and slept for several hours. On
the following morning, when Davis rose early,
neither the old man nor the half-breed were astir.
He prepared a hasty breakfast, deciding not to wake
either one of them. In another hour he would be on
the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>But Harbinson, it appeared, had not slept well.
He had rolled and tossed in a high fever. He lay
now in his bunk, his glassy eyes furtively watching
his partner. When chance took Davis close to the
bunk, he closed his eyes, feigning sleep. This simulation
continued until the younger man had completed
his preparations and had departed. An indescribable
look flitted over the old prospector&rsquo;s
unutterably weary and fevered face. His lips trembled
a phrase:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out in time, thank God!&mdash;good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he slid over to the side of his bunk, dressed
with trembling haste and, hobbling over, began ransacking
a crude pine box, containing articles of apparel.
Finally, he found the object of his search:
a red flannel shirt, which he tore apart.</p>
<p>He crossed the room with the garment under his
arm, picked up a hammer by the door and stole outside.
He reappeared less than two minutes later,
staggering toward his bunk. His expression was
pathetic. He made several futile efforts to remove
his clothes. In the hollow of his cheeks, over his
forehead, along each side of his neck a raging temperature
had left its seal.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, when Baptiste rose noiselessly
and went outside, he started back in amazement.
Again his gaze went back, as if fascinated, to
the flannel signal, fluttering just above the door. A
groan escaped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!&rdquo; he choked. &ldquo;Et ees zee
red flag of quarantine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">INSPECTOR CAMERON TAKES CHARGE</span></h2>
<p>The orderly approached Inspector Cameron&rsquo;s desk
and saluted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man here, sir, from up-country. Calls himself
Davis. Wants to see you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; snapped the inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say, sir, except that it was something
important. Says he knows you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davis&mdash;Davis&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; mused Cameron, chewing
reflectively on his cigar. &ldquo;Perhaps I do. Yes&mdash;young
prospector from up near Garrison. Show
him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Cameron&rsquo;s brow wrinkled when the man
appeared. If he had ever seen this uncouth fellow
before, he could not place him. Surely this was not
the Davis he knew. Why this man looked old&mdash;a
heavy black beard, hair unkempt, disreputable, dirty
clothing. But the voice&mdash;hah!&mdash;&mdash;Davis after all,
the Davis he knew. He extended a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens, man, how you deceived me. You look
terrible. What&rsquo;s happened? Nothing serious, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The visitor dropped into a seat with a sigh of
weariness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be much worse, inspector. I&rsquo;ve trekked
three hundred miles. Tired. Sleepy. About all in.
You see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Davis. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smallpox!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cameron&rsquo;s face blanched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say. How bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible. My country&rsquo;s rotten with it. Whole
villages gone. Mostly among the Indians so far. But
the whites are getting it too. Fort Garrison has
closed its doors. I saw the red flag of quarantine
waving from twenty different cabins on my way
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cameron&rsquo;s jaws clamped over his cigar and his
steel eyes flecked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t I heard about this before?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only two months since we patroled
that region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t a trace of it then,&rdquo; Davis informed
him. &ldquo;You know how these things come. Suddenly.
No explaining it. Two weeks after I heard about the
first case, it had ravaged the whole countryside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been exposed yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The inspector leaned back in his chair, his arms
folded, his gaze seeming to rest upon the papers in
the letter-tray on his desk. He picked up his fountain
pen and turned it thoughtfully in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This thing couldn&rsquo;t have come at a more inopportune
time. Richardson is off on patrol and won&rsquo;t
be back for three weeks. Three days ago a murder
was committed over at Run River, and Pearly
has gone to investigate. Corporal Rand is confined
to barracks here, suffering from an attack
of pneumonia. I haven&rsquo;t an available man right
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s to be done? How do you propose to
combat this thing? Haven&rsquo;t you a supply of medicine
here at barracks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had a room full of it, it wouldn&rsquo;t help us
in the least. There&rsquo;s only one antidote. You inject
it in the arm with a hypodermic needle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can this stuff be obtained?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big cities outside. The only places. Edmonton
is the closest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hopeless!&rdquo; gasped Davis. &ldquo;Half the population
of the North will be swept out of existence before
you can get help from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cameron shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite as bad as that, I hope. We have the
government telegraph and the radio. Within twenty-four
hours Edmonton will send out a relief expedition.
We&rsquo;ll meet them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>As he spoke, the inspector reached forward and
touched the buzzer on his desk. The orderly appeared,
saluted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me the swiftest Indian runner you can find.
Send him here. I want you to hurry, constable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Cameron drew a sheet of paper towards him
and began to write. When he had finished, Davis
inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it will be necessary to wait until one
of your men returns before you send out someone
to meet that relief party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not in this emergency. I&rsquo;ve already decided.
There are three young men living over at Fort Good
Faith who will be glad to help me. One is a nephew
of Factor MacClaren, another a young chap named
Dick Kent, while the third boy is a young Indian
scout called Toma. Two of them, Kent and Toma,
we had planned to send to the mounted police training
barracks at Regina last year, but the school was
crowded and they have been compelled to remain
here awaiting further word from the commissioner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These boys are dependable, you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davis eyed the other reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go myself if you wish, inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in no condition,&rdquo; Cameron replied
promptly. &ldquo;What you need is a rest. But don&rsquo;t
worry about this thing, Davis. We&rsquo;ll be able to check
it before many weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Weeks!&rdquo; Davis&rsquo; voice was sepulchral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, weeks,&rdquo; Cameron reiterated. &ldquo;And we can
be glad that it isn&rsquo;t months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the papers lying on his desk with a
gesture of dismissal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop in at the barracks and they&rsquo;ll fix you up.
I&rsquo;d like to thank you for bringing me this information,
Mr. Davis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after Davis had gone, the orderly entered
the room, accompanied by a tall, sinewy young man,
the Indian runner. The police official greeted the
native with a curt nod, rose and pressed an envelope
in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this to Dick Kent at Fort Good Faith. He&rsquo;s
a young man about your own age. Hurry through
as quickly as you can. It is very important. I will
pay you well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian smiled as he tucked the letter away
in an inner pocket, grinned again for no apparent
reason and stalked silently out of the room. The orderly
still stood, waiting for his own dismissal.
Cameron regarded his subordinate for a moment,
then turned quickly and hurried over to his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constable, we have much to do. Smallpox
epidemic in the country north of us. Sweeping down
this way. Very serious condition. We must move
quickly. I&rsquo;ll ask you to wait here while I write a
message to be sent out by telegraph to Edmonton.
Instruct Mr. Cooley, the operator, to repeat his message
at least three times.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>The orderly saluted, but made no reply. Like a
red-coated statue, he stood while Cameron wrote
quickly. He received the message with another
salute, turned on his heel, his spurs clattering as he
strode to the door. The inspector breathed a sigh of
relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His brow wrinkled with thought. Slowly he turned
again to the work before him. He was busy when
the door opened and the orderly reappeared. One
look at the face of his subordinate told him that
something was amiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Whitehall, what&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orderly hesitated, clearing his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to report, sir, that we won&rsquo;t be able to
establish communication with Edmonton or outside
points. The wires are down. Big forest fire raging
to the south of us, sir. The operator says it will be
days before the damage can be repaired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his agitation, the inspector again rose to his
feet. His eyes snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Mr. O&rsquo;Malley, our radio expert, I want to
see him. Bring him here at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitehall saluted and went out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">SMOKE!</span></h2>
<p>Sandy MacClaren put down the moccasin he
had been attempting to patch and turned to his
friend, Dick Kent, who had been listening attentively
to Sandy&rsquo;s absorbing narrative. The story
dealt with the exciting experiences of one Clement
McTavish, Scotch prospector and trapper, who had
returned from the foothills a few days before. McTavish
had relinquished his former trap-line, seceding
his claims to a more ambitious enemy&mdash;a colony
of murderous grizzlies.</p>
<p>Dick laughed. &ldquo;You mean, Sandy, that those grizzlies
drove him out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy picked up the moccasin again and scowled
at the results of his handiwork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. They drove him out. And he was glad
to go, too. There wasn&rsquo;t just one or two to contend
with&mdash;but a whole regiment. The country was
simply infested with &rsquo;em. McTavish is so badly
frightened that you couldn&rsquo;t get him to go back with
a bodyguard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I talk McTavish,&rdquo; Toma began eagerly.
&ldquo;Where you say he find all these bad grizzlies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four miles east of Lake Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I like to go there,&rdquo; Toma made the assertion
as calmly, as unconcernedly, as if he spoke of
entering the next room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; said Dick, quite ungrammatically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to investigate that story. My personal opinion is
that McTavish was spoofing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; retorted Sandy. &ldquo;What I thought myself.
But there are a few things rather difficult to explain.
McTavish brought back five grizzly pelts and
his arm in a sling. Killed five of &rsquo;em! Think of that!
But in a fight with one of them he got clawed up.
Hurt pretty bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; said Dick with quiet determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go too,&rdquo; Toma echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you fellows are willing to risk it,&rdquo; declared
Sandy, not very enthusiastically, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better
include me in your party. Personally, I&rsquo;m not very
keen about going. I&rsquo;ll have another talk with McTavish
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A knock sounded at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; Sandy shouted.</p>
<p>Factor MacClaren stood framed in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d find you here. Dick,&mdash;someone to
see you. A runner from Mackenzie River. It&rsquo;s important.
He&rsquo;s waiting out in the trading room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Dick rose excitedly and streaked for the door. He
pushed his way past the factor, hurried down the
hallway and soon emerged in the spacious storeroom
of the company. For a brief interval he
paused, gaze darting through the crowd, then made
his way unerringly to a tall young Indian, who stood
waiting near the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dick Kent,&rdquo; said that young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Gar, monsieur, I glad I find you here. Et ees
veree important thees letter from Inspector Cameron.
He told me to geeve et in your own hands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>With trembling fingers Dick broke the seal. He
read:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Mr. Richard Kent,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Fort Good Faith,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Province of Alberta.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Dear Richard:</p>
</div>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;I am compelled to ask you and your two
friends, Sandy MacClaren and John Toma, to
undertake a very urgent and important journey
on behalf of the people in this territory. I received
this morning the news of a terrible smallpox
epidemic, two hundred miles northwest of
here&mdash;an epidemic which can only be checked
through the media of outside help and assistance.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;You will proceed at once to Peace River
Crossing and report there to Inspector Anderson,
who will give you further instructions. I
have notified Edmonton of our plight and have
asked the authorities of that city to send out a
relief expedition, which you are to meet and
conduct back by the shortest route to Mackenzie
River Barracks.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;I need not impress upon you the necessity of
haste. Many lives hang in the balance. May
good fortune attend you.</p>
<p><span class="center">&ldquo;Sincerely,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;Jason C. Cameron,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;Inspector R. N. W. M. P.,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;Mackenzie River Barracks.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His face very sober, Dick thrust the letter in his
pocket, thanked the messenger and hurried back
through the hallway in time to meet Sandy and
Toma, both of whom were laughing and scuffling as
they came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! What is it?&rdquo; Sandy piped out in a tone of
voice intended to be jocular. &ldquo;Invitation to a wedding
or a message from the War Department?
We&rsquo;re dying to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy checked himself, however, as he perceived
Dick&rsquo;s serious look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Smallpox north of the Mackenzie. A terrible
epidemic. Inspector Cameron has asked us to go
south to meet a relief expedition, which is being sent
up from Edmonton. We leave at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as soon as we can get ready. You boys
pack your things together while I see Mr. MacClaren
and arrange for the supplies&mdash;our grubstake. We&rsquo;ll
take our ponies for the first stage of the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys separated hurriedly, each going to his
own particular task, nimble fingers and hands making
short work of their preparations. Within thirty minutes
they had &ldquo;packed&rdquo; one of the company&rsquo;s ponies
and had their own saddled and bridled. It was exactly
two o&rsquo;clock by the factor&rsquo;s watch when they bolted
into their seats and waved an enthusiastic farewell.
A short time later they cantered across the meadow
and swung south on a well-beaten trail.</p>
<p>At Fort Bentley, three days later, they secured
fresh mounts and another pack-horse. It was while
they were resting for a few hours here that they received
their first disappointing news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big fire raging to the south of here,&rdquo; stated Nesbitt,
the factor. &ldquo;The area affected is wide&mdash;hundreds
of square miles, lying on the east side of the Peace.
Unless you make a wide detour, you&rsquo;ll never get
through. It will be impossible to travel along the
direct route to Peace River Crossing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faces of the three messengers fell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; exclaimed Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My advice to you,&rdquo; Factor Nesbitt hurried on,
&ldquo;is to proceed straight west to Fort Vermilion, thence
travel along the west side of the river until you
reach the Crossing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will there be any chance to get a boat at Vermilion?&rdquo;
Dick asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so. Company boats will be running
up to Peace until the freeze-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys decided to go that way. Both Dick and
Sandy had visited Fort Vermilion on a previous
occasion. They recalled with a great deal of pleasure
their meeting with Sheridan Lawrence, the intrepid
pioneer, who had achieved almost world-wide renown
for his enterprise and foresight. There in the
heart of a wilderness were hundreds of acres of cultivated
fields, mills, an electric light plant, and the
bustling activity of a progressive modern village.</p>
<p>Lawrence possessed launches and boats of his own
and would be eager to help in a worthy cause. With
this valuable assistance, the boys would be able to
make the trip from Fort Vermilion to Peace River
Crossing in a very short time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our best plan,&rdquo; approved Dick. &ldquo;Do you suppose,
Mr. Nesbitt, that the fire has worked very far
north?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say. All I know is that it&rsquo;s one of
the worst we have had in years. A trapper who arrived
here yesterday from that region reported that
it had destroyed the government telegraph line and
had completely wiped out Jess Haldane&rsquo;s trading
post on Little Brush Creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Brush Creek!&rdquo; Sandy frowned at the information.
&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s only about twenty miles
south of the trail we propose to take now&mdash;the one
to Fort Vermilion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dick, turning to his chum. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s farther
than that. I&rsquo;d call it a good fifty miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, have your own way. But what&rsquo;s fifty miles
to a fire like that? By the time we get there, it may
be raging not only south but north of the trail as
well. You can&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite possible,&rdquo; Dick agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; appended Nesbitt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little
afraid that no matter which way you go, south to
Peace River Crossing or west to Fort Vermilion, you
stand a good chance of meeting the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what we can do,&rdquo; proposed Sandy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll strike out for the Peace, not west, but northwest
of here and follow it up to Fort Vermilion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Nesbitt both laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take us hundreds of miles out of our way and
through a country almost impassable,&rdquo; Dick objected.
&ldquo;Not a single trail to guide us. No, it would
be foolish to attempt it. Our best plan is to follow
the Vermilion trail and then, if necessary, circle
around the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With considerable misgiving, they started out.
Three days from Fort Bentley they made their way
into an enveloping cloud of smoke, so thick and dark
that at times it was almost impossible to see the sun.
It formed a huge blanket which wrapped the earth.
Hourly, it grew denser; breathing more difficult. It
soon became apparent that they would be unable to
get through. Turning to their right, they entered a
densely wooded area, groping and gasping for breath.
At times it was almost as dark as night. The smoke
which settled around them was of a greenish tinge.
It crept up the coulees and hollows in twisting snake-like
form, while above the treetops swirled a heavy
black cloud.</p>
<p>That night the stars were hid, but off to the
southeast the sky was an orange curtain of fire. Its
lurid glow lit up the horizon, a ghastly and awesome
sight, giving the impression that the earth itself was
being devastated, devoured by the ruthless monster
of flame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>On and on the boys hurried in an effort to pass
safely around the terrible conflagration. Worry and
apprehension shadowed the faces of the three as
they paused for their evening meal. Little was said.
Their eyes were smarting and their throats burned.
In spite of their weariness, the ponies grew restless
and frightened, pawing and stamping the ground,
sometimes raising their heads and, with distended
nostrils, neighing plaintively.</p>
<p>Again the boys pushed on. Dick took the lead,
wondering how much longer he and his two companions
could bear up under the strain. Fortunately
the coming of night did not interfere materially with
their progress. The forest was illuminated. The
ghostly reflection of the fire was cast across their
path.</p>
<p>Every hour was taking them closer and closer to
the northern end of the great conflagration. Not far
ahead they could see the flaming blood-red sheet.
Its close proximity struck terror in their hearts. It
was a race with death. Their only advantage was the
help of the wind, from the northwest, whose chill,
unabating blasts contrived to keep the oncoming fury
somewhat in check. If the wind fell, their only
hope of escape lay in a precipitous retreat to the
north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it,&rdquo; said Sandy, moistening his
parched lips, &ldquo;if that northwester continues to hold.
But it may die down before midnight. Sometimes I
think that it doesn&rsquo;t blow as hard as it did a few
hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must get through, Sandy,&rdquo; Dick declared
grimly. &ldquo;If necessary, we&rsquo;ll ride our horses until
they drop. Think of the lives that hang in the balance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after midnight they approached so close
to the fire that the stillness through which they had
been travelling gave place to a rumbling, crackling
roar. A withering, scorching heat came out to them.
The ponies seemed to stagger under their burdens.
Dick, who was in the lead, waved his arm encouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few more miles,&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No can make!&rdquo; Toma&rsquo;s voice suddenly rose above
the deafening roar about them. &ldquo;My pony him no
walk any farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy dismounted quickly and went back
to where the young guide&rsquo;s horse stood quivering and
panting. Toma loosened the cinches and drew off the
saddle just as the exhausted beast sank to the ground.
Each one of the boys knew what was about to happen&mdash;what
ought to be done&mdash;but each waited for the
others to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take &rsquo;em what supplies you can from packhorse,&rdquo;
Toma ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;the rest we&rsquo;ll have to leave
here. Throw your saddle on the pack-horse, Toma,
and lead him up where the other ponies are. Wait
there for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy turned a white face in the direction of his
chum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really going to do it, Dick?&rdquo; he quavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate to,&rdquo; answered the other, attempting to conceal
the tremor in his voice. &ldquo;But hurry on, Sandy.
I&rsquo;ll join you in just a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Determinedly he turned, one hand trembling above
his holster and walked over to where the doomed
pony lay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE FIRE PATROL</span></h2>
<p>A few hours before daybreak they had successfully
circled the fire and had reached a sparsely
wooded height of land. So tired and worn out were
the three messengers, that as soon as they had
picketed out their ponies, they crawled into their
blankets without troubling to prepare something to
eat. Dick had almost fallen asleep when he was
startled by a most peculiar sound&mdash;a sound so unusual
and different from anything that he had ever
heard since coming to the northern wilderness, that
he sat bolt upright, wondering if his senses had
not suddenly deserted him.</p>
<p>The metallic thub, thub, thub grew louder. He
sat staring in the darkness, bewildered, a little
frightened, and yet very curious to know its cause.
More than anything else, it sounded like a high-powered
motor boat, such as he had often seen and
heard near his own home on the Great Lakes, back
in the United States. Yet it was not a motor boat.
They were still forty miles from the Peace River,
and no body of water of any extent lay between them
and the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Then, suddenly, he had it. An airplane! His
mouth curved in a smile of wonder and admiration.
An airplane! What was it doing here? With an unearthly
howl, he bounded to his feet and was soon
shaking Sandy and Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up! Wake up!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Listen to
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daubing one hand across his sleep-dimmed eyes,
Sandy gave vent to an ejaculation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the love of Pete! Where did that come
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately he broke forth in a howl of glee,
pointing a finger at Toma. In all his long acquaintance
with the young Indian, Dick had never seen
the guide display any great amount of fear; yet he
was frightened now. He sat huddled in his blankets,
frozen with a nameless panic. Here was something
beyond his ken and experience&mdash;to him an inexplicable,
supernatural thing: A noise from the heavens,
some horrible monster swooping down upon them
from the black vault of the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you&mdash;you call &rsquo;em that?&rdquo; he finally stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Airplane,&rdquo; said Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boat that flies through the air,&rdquo; Dick elucidated.
&ldquo;What do you suppose it&rsquo;s doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The sound grew louder and presently the plane
alighted less than two hundred yards away. The
boys raced madly along through the darkness, finally
coming out in an open space, where they could see
a dark blur and hear the sound of voices.</p>
<p>Approaching, Dick hailed them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there! Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dominion Government cruising plane, C 94,&rdquo;
came the prompt answer. &ldquo;Put out from Peace River
Crossing to investigate this fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two men stood beside the plane and when the
boys came up plied them with questions. Had they
come through the fire? Were there many cabins destroyed
in the country north of there? Where were
the boys going?</p>
<p>Sandy and Dick gave them what information they
could, in turn asking many questions of their own.
Then Dick stated their errand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been sent out by Inspector Cameron to
meet a relief party, which is bringing help to the
people suffering from smallpox in the remote districts
north of the Mackenzie. The situation is very
serious. Hundreds have already died from the
disease and probably hundreds more will before assistance
can arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horace Alderby, one of the aviators, spoke up
quickly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Queer we didn&rsquo;t hear anything about it when
we left the Crossing. I should think that if Inspector
Cameron had wired to Edmonton the people
at Peace River&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here, Horace,&rdquo; interrupted the other,
&ldquo;have you forgotten that the wires are down as a
result of this fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Randall, so I have,&rdquo; laughed Alderby.
&ldquo;The line is clear from Peace River Crossing to Edmonton,
but north the service has been disrupted.
It is quite likely,&rdquo; turning to the boys, &ldquo;that your
Inspector Cameron has not been able to get in touch
with Edmonton at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;It makes it all the
more important why we should hurry on and send
in the news from Peace River Crossing. Our plan
is to go over to Fort Vermilion and from there
try to secure a ride up the Peace in a steam or motor
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good three days&rsquo; trip,&rdquo; stated Alderby.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fortunate we ran across you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Sandy asked innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; the aviator replied, &ldquo;we can take you
over there ourselves just as soon as we look over
our motor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did motor trouble force you to land?&rdquo; Dick inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s nothing serious. We&rsquo;ll have it ready
in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble is,&rdquo; said Randall, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s room only for
one of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement immediately relieved Toma&rsquo;s mind.
He had begun to fear that he would be asked to sail
through the sky in the bowels of that awesome monster&mdash;an
invitation he had firmly decided to decline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right me, Dick. Mebbe you or Sandy
go, but I like stay here with the ponies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick will have to go, of course,&rdquo; Sandy stated,
experiencing a moment or two of regret as he looked
at the plane and thought of the thrilling ride through
the clouds. &ldquo;As Toma just said, he and I can remain
here with the ponies. We&rsquo;ll make camp and wait for
your return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, you can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; Dick expostulated.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be in danger here with the fire
so close. You never can tell when the wind may
change and blow it this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we no stay here,&rdquo; Toma enlightened him.
&ldquo;We go on to Fort Vermilion. You come back that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>It seemed a good arrangement and soon afterward
Dick climbed aboard, crouching down in the limited
space assigned to him. He felt a little nervous now
that they were about to start. At the first crackling
roar of the powerful motor, his heart leaped up in
his throat. He called out something unintelligible to
Sandy and Toma, grabbed for his hat as the plane
commenced bounding along the uneven ground, then
stole one frightened look over the side just as the
earth commenced to drop away from him in a manner
that was both sickening and disconcerting.
Nearly ten minutes had passed before he had recovered
sufficiently from the shock to realize that he had
actually started out on his first journey through the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like it?&rdquo; asked Randall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do-o-n&rsquo;t kn-n-ow yet,&rdquo; he managed to articulate.
&ldquo;How long are we going to be up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a few hours,&rdquo;&mdash;reassuringly.</p>
<p>Just a few hours! Saints and martyrs! Could he
stand it that long? When minutes were terrible, what
would hours be like? Instantly he dismissed what
remained of a once overpowering ambition to become
an aviator. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly in his line anyway.
He lacked the necessary physical qualifications.
He hadn&rsquo;t realized it before, not until now, but his
stomach was weak. It felt as if there was a big hole
there, through which a current of cold air passed
every few seconds at a terrific rate of speed. It made
him almost ill.</p>
<p>In an effort to keep his thoughts in more comfortable
channels, he addressed himself to Randall:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said this was a government plane?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the ready answer, &ldquo;one of five sent
out to this north country to assist in the prevention
and control of forest fires. The country will need
all this valuable timber some day. Millions of dollars
going up in smoke. Time we put a stop to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randall&rsquo;s voice trailed off and became lost in the
roar of the motor and the screeching of the wind.
Dick tried to stretch his legs. He tried to sleep. He
endeavored to accustom himself to the queer, unpleasant
motion of the plane. He was unutterably
glad when he heard Alderby trumpeting in Randall&rsquo;s
ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crossing lights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick steeled himself and looked down. Ahead and
far below he perceived a faint effulgence&mdash;like glow-worms
shining feebly across a vale of darkness.</p>
<p>Not long afterward they began to descend. Hills
took shape. The wide ribbon of the Peace and the
Hart, cascading down through the hills to join it.
The shape of trees, the rugged contours of the land
and, finally, straight below them, a level field, which
seemed to come up, up, up to meet them, and upon
which, a short time later, they landed in safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; exclaimed the jovial voice of Alderby.</p>
<p>In the chill, gray light of dawn, Dick followed
Randall past the hangar and into the town. His
heart was beating jubilantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>His companion led the way through the streets of
the little town, pausing at length in front of a small
brick building, which served as an office for the
government telegraph. The door was locked, but
following a short rattling at the knob, they were admitted
by a sleepy operator, who demanded to know
their business.</p>
<p>In a few words, Randall explained the reason for
their early call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would like to know,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;if you
have any information concerning a smallpox epidemic
in the north, or of a relief party which has
been sent out from Edmonton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know something about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The operator invited them inside and switched on
the lights. He in turn asked a question of Randall:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this one of the young men Cameron instructed
to come here to meet the relief party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Randall could answer, Dick produced the
letter he had received from the Indian messenger
and handed it over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will serve as my introduction. Read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; exclaimed the operator, glancing over the
missive. &ldquo;Yes, Cameron got his message through.
The relief expedition is already on its way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought the government line was out of
order, had been destroyed by the fire north of here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;So it was. Inspector Cameron&rsquo;s s.o.s. was broadcast
by radio from Mackenzie River and someone
in Edmonton picked it up. The message was repeated
again early this morning. It&rsquo;s common property now
all over the province. Every available airplane in
Edmonton and Calgary is being sent up. A few of
the planes ought to arrive any time. Also a special
passenger train is scheduled to arrive tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can the airplanes go as far north as the Mackenzie?&rdquo;
Dick asked.</p>
<p>Randall replied in the affirmative. &ldquo;The only difficulty
is to carry enough gasoline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Dick, a little crestfallen, &ldquo;our
services will no longer be required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. You&rsquo;ll have plenty to do,&rdquo; laughed
the operator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your troubles have only commenced,&rdquo; smiled
Randall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you back and pick up your friends
at Fort Vermilion, then we&rsquo;ll pilot the other planes
through to the Mackenzie. You&rsquo;ll be a regular air-hawk
before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the operator. &ldquo;Thank you very much
for your kindness. I think I&rsquo;ll take Dick over to one
of the hotels and then slip back to the flying field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to a hotel just yet,&rdquo; Dick interposed.
&ldquo;I was told to report to Inspector Anderson at the
police barracks here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Hardly were they in the street again, when the
aviator clutched Dick&rsquo;s shoulder with one hand, while
with the other he pointed aloft. Through the still
air there came to them the distant strum, strum,
strum of a motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The first plane from Edmonton!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">MACKENZIE RIVER POST</span></h2>
<p>Convalescing after a serious illness, Corporal
Rand found it expedient on this bright autumnal
morning to rise, don his uniform and go for a stroll
along the banks of the mighty Mackenzie River.
He was still very weak and shaky as a result of his
long confinement at barracks hospital, yet the crisp,
still air was tonic in its effect and something of his
old cheerfulness and buoyancy returned as he proceeded
along the narrow footpath leading away from
the post.</p>
<p>The corporal&rsquo;s thoughts touched upon many subjects.
Above all, was he glad to know that he would
soon be able to return to duty. The tedium and
monotony of what amounted almost to imprisonment
would soon be at an end. Accustomed to a life
of ceaseless activity, he yearned to be on the trail
again. The old restlessness was in his blood. Before
starting out he had paid a visit to Inspector Cameron.
With a smile he recalled the interview with his chief
and in retrospect, he saw himself again, standing at
attention before the grizzled and stern director of
police activities in that part of the North.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how are you feeling, corporal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words had been snapped out at him in the
usual brisk, nervous manner, the man&rsquo;s steel-gray
eyes carrying no hint of the real feeling behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to report for duty, sir,&rdquo; he made the
statement carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Duty! You&rsquo;re pale as a ghost, man.
Shaky! Wonder how you dare to come here with
your deceptions. Back to the barracks with you and
don&rsquo;t let me see you again until you&rsquo;re a well man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand smiled, saluted, and half-turned to leave the
room when a thought came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No objections to my taking a stroll, sir? Think
the fresh air will do me good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the inspector a little crisply, then
turned to his work, only to raise his eyes again as
Rand walked over in the direction of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold. Have you heard the latest news, corporal?&rdquo;&mdash;more
kindly.</p>
<p>Rand hesitated, one hand on the knob of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news. Wonderful news.&rdquo; Cameron&rsquo;s eyes
were sparkling now. &ldquo;Most astonishing too. The
relief expedition left Peace River Crossing yesterday
and will be here before night. Marvelous!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Rand wondered if he had heard aright. There was a
faint trace of incredulity in his voice as he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marvelous, indeed, sir. Last year Sergeant Richardson
made the trip in a little less than ten days.
Who&rsquo;s leading this expedition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Kent,&rdquo; answered the other.</p>
<p>Corporal Rand was smiling broadly now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have sprouted a pair of wings, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it exactly. They&rsquo;re coming by airplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand recalled his astonishment at this unexpected
bit of information. Amazement widened his eyes.
He turned swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Airplanes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I don&rsquo;t understand it myself. If they make
it, it will be the first time in history. The petrol supply
will be their chief trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great experience for Dick and Sandy,&rdquo; mused
the corporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about them. I was thinking
about the hundreds of poor devils up north, whose
lives will be spared if that flight should prove successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir, that&rsquo;s true. A sort of race against
death, isn&rsquo;t it? By the way, inspector, how is the
smallpox situation now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Appalling! The reports I have received stagger
me. The ratio of persons who die after incurring the
disease is about four out of every six. The epidemic
has spread out over a very wide area. It has already
reached the Eskimo tribes on the eastern side of the
barren lands. They&rsquo;re dying like flies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;ll have sufficient medicine and
men for the whole of the territory affected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. Nevertheless, we&rsquo;ll do the best we
can. If Kent and his two friends get through safely,
I&rsquo;m sending them up to the barrens with one physician
and as much of the remedy as we can possibly spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Corporal Rand looked out across the valley. The
opposite bank of the river flamed with the gold and
bronze of autumn&rsquo;s foliage. Though the season was
getting late, the weather was glorious. Not a breath
of wind. The sun shone from an unclouded, deep-azure
sky. Large flocks of wild geese went honking
overhead.</p>
<p>A little regretfully, Rand turned and retraced his
steps. It would soon be time for the midday meal,
and he was hungry. Tomorrow, he decided, he would
see the inspector again and repeat his request. Perhaps
he might be ordered out for duty. Perhaps he
might be permitted to do his part in a worthy cause.
In any event, once on the trail, he would soon forget
his weakness, probably gain new strength, be more
like his former self.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>He spent the afternoon reading and loitering
about, but just before sundown went outside in the
hope that he might catch sight of the planes of the
relief expedition. In this, however, he was disappointed,
although he scanned the southern skies until
long after twilight. He returned to the barracks
troubled by a strange premonition. He tried to read,
but threw down the book before he could become interested.
He paced the rough floor of his room,
puffing nervously at his pipe, his mind filled with a
hundred vague alarms.</p>
<p>Reason, finally, came to his rescue. How foolish
he was. The party would probably arrive during the
night. His senseless worrying, no doubt, was caused
by his recent illness and the nervous tension of being
confined to the barracks. Shortly after midnight,
when Constable Whitehall, the orderly, entered his
room to wish him good-night, he had regained a
great deal of his previous cheerfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how are things?&rdquo; he inquired of his visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I guess, but the old man&rsquo;s worrying
about that expedition. Says it should have been here
before this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been worrying, too,&rdquo; Rand admitted. &ldquo;Do
you suppose anything has gone wrong, Whitehall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The constable wagged his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t say. Personally, I think they&rsquo;ll be in
before morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather difficult to make a landing in the dark,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it would,&rdquo; the corporal answered his
own question. &ldquo;Beastly dark night. Like the inside
of a pocket. You don&rsquo;t suppose they&rsquo;ve been driven
off their course or have lost their way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; exclaimed Whitehall. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as
fidgety as the chief himself. Everything will be all
right, I&rsquo;m sure. My advice to you is to hop into
bed. This sort of thing isn&rsquo;t good for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time after the two friends separated,
Rand rolled and tossed in his bed, obsessed by that
queer and unexplainable premonition. He fell into
a sleep which was fitful and broken. Through his
dreams ran a thread of horror. He woke repeatedly.
Finally, he threw back the covers, rose and lit the
oil lamp which stood on a table near the head of his
bed, and once more essayed to read. Impatiently, he
threw the book from him, darted to his feet and
commenced pacing back and forth, now and again
pausing to pull aside the curtain and look out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Daylight found him shaved, fully dressed, waiting
for the stir of life about the barracks. The rattle of
a granite plate in the kitchen at the back came as a
signal for his release from the trying ordeal of the
night. He pulled on his short fur coat and walked
outside, wandering listlessly away in the direction of
the stables and dog compound. To his surprise, he
perceived that another person was already abroad.
Approaching closer, his astonishment increased. Inspector
Cameron!&mdash;a somewhat ludicrous figure that
morning: Head bent, jaws clamped over a cigar,
arms behind his back. He shambled to within a few
feet of Rand before he looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;&mdash;fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither could I. Rotten luck! What do you
suppose became of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the planes, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they ought to be in this morning,&rdquo; Rand
stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should have been in last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they lapsed into silence, each regarding
the other intently. Finally the corporal plucked up
enough courage to make his request:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve no objections, inspector, I&rsquo;d like to
return to duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cameron glared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really all right,&rdquo; Rand hastened to inform
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the inspector, throwing
away his cigar and staring fiercely at his subordinate.
&ldquo;I told you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; yes, I know,&rdquo; said Rand softly. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
this way, sir. There is much that I can do to help
out at this critical time. A few days in the open
air and I&rsquo;ll be perfectly well again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it. Lord knows we need you. I
may possibly be compelled to go out myself. Report
to me this afternoon at two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They separated, each going his own way. After
breakfast, Rand secured his gun and went out in the
vicinity of the post to hunt geese. When he returned,
it was well past the lunch hour and when he had
eaten it was almost time for his interview with
Cameron.</p>
<p>When he had arrived there, the inspector&rsquo;s office
was a scene of unusual activity. Four stalwart half-breeds
stood in front of Cameron&rsquo;s desk, and the
orderly directly behind them. The room was sticky
and hot. Cameron&rsquo;s hair was rumpled and he was
issuing orders in crisp, choppy tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have your instructions,&rdquo; Rand heard him
state. &ldquo;Now take your ponies and go out and see
what you can do. Search the country carefully and
make inquiries wherever you can. I&rsquo;ll expect you
back in two days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The natives went out of the room, followed by
the orderly, then Rand, seeing his chance, walked up
in front of the inspector&rsquo;s desk. Cameron did not
even look up as he made a notation on a pad in front
of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, corporal, I have a job for you. Proceed
at once to Keechewan with your horse and full
equipment. Know where that is, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the corporal saluted. &ldquo;Just south of
the barren lands. What&rsquo;s the trouble up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that. Natives causing no end of
trouble at the Keechewan mission. It&rsquo;s an outgrowth
of this smallpox trouble. The Indians seem to think
that the plague has been sent among them by the
gods of the white man. The missionaries have
warded off two attacks by the infuriated inhabitants
of the Indian village, just south of Keechewan. Your
duty, corporal, will be to straighten this thing up.
Endeavor to instil a friendly feeling among the
Indians. If any lives have been taken, bring in the
murderers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Corporal Rand manifested any sign of the fear
that was in his heart, it was not noticeable to his
chief. He merely saluted and inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any further instructions, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cameron rose to his feet, strode around his desk,
and, to the corporal&rsquo;s surprise, placed a trembling
hand upon his arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how I hate to do this, Rand. I
don&rsquo;t want to send you up there without first having
you inoculated. You may be going to your death&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
be perfectly frank with you. I wish there was
some other way. I&rsquo;ve thought long and carefully
over this matter and I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that
unless we send help to the mission at once, it may
be too late. All of them may be murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, sir. I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cameron seized the other&rsquo;s hand and held it during
an interval of oppressive silence. There was no
thought now of the inequality of rank. Man to man,
brothers in a common cause&mdash;each understood and
appreciated the other&rsquo;s attitude and feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Rand, &ldquo;for letting me go,
permitting me to do this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked out of the post with a queer smile on
his lips. He hurried away in the direction of the
stables, his heart beating exultantly. His hand still
tingled from Cameron&rsquo;s steel-like yet affectionate
clasp. Dazedly, he groomed and saddled his horse
and was in the very act of leading it outside, when
Whitehall appeared at the stable door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop everything at once and come back to the
office. Cameron wants to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand threw the reins over his horse&rsquo;s head, and
followed the orderly back to barracks. Again he
stood in front of his chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rand, I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. I&rsquo;ve decided not
to send you after all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Rand gulped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t change your mind on my account. I&rsquo;m
willing to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut! Tut! I&rsquo;m in command here. You&rsquo;ll do as
I say. I want you to take charge during my absence.
I&rsquo;ve already written a few instructions for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be away long, sir?&rdquo; Rand asked tremblingly,
a vague suspicion in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several weeks, I expect. I&rsquo;m going to Keechewan
in your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my place!&rdquo; A sudden blinding weakness overcame
the corporal. &ldquo;In&mdash;in my place!&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>For a period of at least five minutes the room
was as quiet as death. Then, suddenly, Rand&rsquo;s voice
rang out clearly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inspector Cameron, you&rsquo;re a man! But I am
too. My horse is saddled and waiting for me. I
hate to disobey you, sir, but I&rsquo;m leaving at once.
When I return from the Barrens&mdash;if I ever do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
report here and you can place me under arrest.
Good-bye, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saluted briskly and turned away. Inspector
Cameron was still gaping when the door closed
softly after the retreating figure.</p>

<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">SHIPS FROM THE STARS</span></h2>
<p>A wonderful huntsman was Kantisepa, the very
greatest among his people. In his aimless journeying
he had passed over a large part of the vast, immutable
north, proceeding far from known haunts into
lands which seldom had heard the footfalls of the
hunter. He had viewed wild scenes, the glory and
grandeur of which few other eyes had seen. Unnamed
rivers and lakes, lofty mountains, interminable
swamps, places so barren and devoid of all
vegetation, so breathless, weird and forlorn that life
passed on in horror, fearful of the madness that
lurked there&mdash;all these he had looked upon during
his ceaseless pilgrimages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>He had hunted moose and caribou and the ferocious
black bears of the mountains. Once he had
fought off a wolf with no better weapon than a club.
His long association with the wild and its denizens
had bred in him a certain uncanny wisdom. Insects
and beasts and birds&mdash;he knew them all with the
unerring certainty of a trained naturalist. Yet now,
standing in the bright glare of the sun, gaze focused
on certain huge dark specks in the distant horizon,
it was evident from his expression that at last he had
seen something he could not classify.</p>
<p>Two birds of mammoth, gigantic size were flying
straight towards him. Larger than a moose or
bear, of greater size even than the largest tepee, they
sailed through the air, drumming as they went. Their
speed and size and the horrible noise they made so
frightened poor Kantisepa, that he crouched low in
a thicket, resolving under no circumstances to show
himself to the invaders.</p>
<p>Two of the huge birds flew close together&mdash;evidently
for companionship. The third one, probably
much younger&mdash;for it was smaller&mdash;brought up the
rear, at a considerable distance behind its mates. As
this bird drew close to the clearing, an incredible
thing happened. It fluttered suddenly and began to
fall. It came down, spinning, righted itself, coasted
along for quite a distance, as if planning to alight,
then lost control of its equilibrium entirely and
crashed to the ground with such a sickening thud
that Kantisepa was quite sure that it was destroyed
utterly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The two other birds were almost out of sight
when the catastrophe occurred. These, Kantisepa
considered, must be the parent birds, and in their
eagerness to reach their destination, had probably
forgotten their offspring, which was probably just
learning to fly. At any rate, though the Indian stood
a long time waiting, the others did not return and,
finally, overcome by the natural curiosity of his race,
he set out in the direction of the luckless victim.</p>
<p>When he had approached to within a few hundred
yards of his objective, he was startled almost out of
his senses. Crawling out of the mass of broken
wings and fragments of the bird&rsquo;s body, came a
curious animal, which in many respects resembled a
man. A very marked difference between the creature
and a man was the enormous size of the creature&rsquo;s
eyes&mdash;three or four times larger than the eyes of his
own people&mdash;composed of some peculiar substance
which glinted and sparkled under the bright reflection
of the sun. Then Kantisepa noted another
peculiarity: Although possessing legs almost identical
to his own, this strange being did not stand
upon them in the ordinary manner, but chose instead
to walk on both arms and legs, as a bear sometimes
walks. Of a very ready and open mind, Kantisepa
could explain the creature&rsquo;s presence in only one way:
a parasite of some kind, possessing the same relationship
to the bird as a flea would to a dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Coming still closer, he was forced to readjust his
first impressions. He knew wood and iron when he
saw it. He gasped in wonderment. No bird at all!
Instead a magic ship, a marvelous creation, invested
with the strange power of sailing through the air.
It, together with the two others, had come from
some remote land beyond the stars. Trembling in
every limb, he approached the strange being, who
had crawled away from the wreckage of the ship.
The creature was grievously hurt. Blood trickled on
the ground beneath him. He had abandoned his efforts
to crawl away and now lay perfectly still, his
shoulders heaving in distress and pain.</p>
<p>Not without pity, Kantisepa shuddered at the
sorry sight. With a slight grimace, he turned and
walked over to examine the magic ship. Peering
down within the center of the wreckage, he saw the
form of another creature, identical to the first except
that this one was hopelessly crushed and apparently
quite dead. He withdrew his gaze quickly
and turned back again to the first being, who still retained
some signs of life.</p>
<p>Kantisepa quickly decided upon a course of action.
He walked forward, stooped down and picked
up the man from beyond the stars and started off
in the direction of the village. He would take him
to the chief medicine man, who, if he could not actually
save the creature&rsquo;s life, could at least place
him on exhibition for the benefit of his curious
kinsmen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The village was a good six miles away, but the
stalwart Indian on previous occasions had carried
heavier burdens. He would proceed half way to his
destination that night and the remainder on the following
morning. He was forced to move slowly and
to rest often. The hours passed. Finally the sun slid
down to a far corner of the world until only a dazzling
sector of light remained. Kantisepa made camp
just as night dropped its curtain of dusk over the
earth. Near at hand, he could hear the murmur of a
tiny stream, above which a mist arose, spreading out
gradually like a gray protecting shroud above the
natural willow hedges fringing the stream. Presently,
the dew wet the grass. With a mournful, unearthly
cry, a night bird swooped down to the place
where Kantisepa stood, rising again on whirring
wings to the dark vault of the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an ill omen,&rdquo; he thought, a sudden fear
gripping his heart.</p>
<p>And so through the brooding, interminable hours
he had remained awake. First he had bathed and
dressed the wounds of the strange being, then, wrapping
him in his own blanket to shut out the damp
cool air, he had kept silent vigil. Time crept on, its
movements so slow and wearied that it seemed to him
that day would never come. The tense silence oppressed
him. It throbbed in his ears until the reaction
of any slight sound smote sharply upon him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Morning came at last, heralded by flaming colors
in the east, preceded by a fitful breeze that stirred
the dry grass uneasily at his feet. Kantisepa was
very tired. His body was stiff and sore. When he
picked up the strange being again to resume his journey,
his legs trembled, scarcely supporting him.</p>
<p>Late that morning he stumbled into the Indian
encampment. Like many brown inverted cones were
the dwellings that stood row on row within a narrow,
peaceful valley. Through the center of the village
trickled a brook, which was fed from numerous
small springs bubbling up between broken rocks.</p>
<p>The place slept in a glare of brilliant sunlight.
Dogs lay curled up in the shade of the tepees. Children
played listlessly in the dead grass or waded
knee-deep in the riffles of the brook. Here and there
Kantisepa discerned the squat indolent forms of
women and, farther on, standing at the extreme end
of a willow copse, a single solitary hunter.</p>
<p>Suddenly the village came out of its picturesque
somnolence. A dog barked unexpectedly near at
hand. Magically, the plain became dotted with a
scurrying throng. Men, women and children tumbled
forth from drab tepees. Sharp cries arose. Led by
the most nimble of foot, the entire populace raced
forward to meet the returning hunter. Soon he was
completely surrounded. Inquisitive eyes peered down
at the strange being. Kantisepa was forced to put
down his burden and immediately a babble of voices
arose, continuing until a tall, gaudily-apparelled warrior
pushed his way through to the spot and waved
one arm peremptorily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this you have brought among us?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange god from the skies,&rdquo; Kantisepa answered
proudly. &ldquo;He came on a ship which sailed
through the clouds, but which met with disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure he will not bring a curse upon us?&rdquo;
inquired the old warrior.</p>
<p>Kantisepa wiped the perspiration from his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is without friends and without people,&rdquo; he
asserted. &ldquo;A number of his comrades in other magic
ships of the air saw him fall but did not come to his
rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief stooped down and examined the partially
conscious figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a young man&mdash;a mere stripling youth. Did
he travel alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kantisepa shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there was one other with him, who now is
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a wave of his arm, the chief dismissed the
jostling crowd and turned again to the hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done well,&rdquo; he complimented him.
&ldquo;Raise him up and bring him to my tepee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morning had passed. South the sun swept through
blue unclouded skies. Together Kantisepa and the
chief went forward through a lane of curious natives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;This being is hurt and cannot return to his
people,&rdquo; said Kantisepa. &ldquo;His wonder ship of the air
became demolished when it fell from the clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered the tepee where Kantisepa deposited
his burden gently on a soft rabbit-robe, then rose
with a weary gesture and turned again to the headman
of his tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a strange story,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Yet it is true.
If you will summon the chief men of the village, this
afternoon I will lead you and them to the magic
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">RETURNING MEMORY</span></h2>
<p>When Dick sat up he saw the walls of a tepee, the
tall form of an Indian of doubtful age, dressed in
beaded moosehide, and the shadow of still another
figure on his right and a little behind him. Kantisepa&rsquo;s
ministering effort had not been in vain. The
strange being had recovered consciousness!</p>
<p>As Dick&rsquo;s mind grew clearer, memory came back
to him. He recalled the flight through the air from
Peace River Crossing. As far as Fort Vermilion
he had travelled with Randall, but there had given
up his place to Sandy and Toma, he himself
entering the plane which was being piloted by
Cliff Stewart, a member of the Edmonton relief
expedition.</p>
<p>From that very moment their trouble had started.
In &ldquo;taking-off&rdquo; Stewart had slightly injured his
machine in a collision with a tree. Later there had
been trouble with the motor. Two hundred miles
north of Fort Vermilion, a few minutes before the
final tragedy, Dick had heard a sudden crackling
noise and had seen Stewart&rsquo;s face turn pale as he had
reached for the controlling levers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Dick shuddered at the memory of that fall from
the skies when the plane became unmanageable. A
terrifying spinning sensation, a horrible rush of air
from below, the cracking and splitting of wood and
steel, culminating in a terrific descent and the lapse
of consciousness.</p>
<p>How he had contrived to escape with his life
seemed more than a miracle. Had Stewart been
equally as fortunate? Who had brought him here?
He looked up into the expressionless eyes of the old
Indian who stood opposite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; he asked in Cree.</p>
<p>The old chief started. Here indeed was undeniable
evidence of the divinity of this strange being. He
was a god surely. Did he not speak the language
of their tribe, this stranger who had come from
some shadowy land beyond the moon?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glorious one, do not fear. You are safe among
friends. I give you my assurance and the assurance
of all my people. We are deeply honored by your
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who brought me here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; the man beside him spoke up unhesitatingly.
&ldquo;When the magic ship crashed to the earth,
I bore you here in my own arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my companion?&rdquo; trembled Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the young man could not speak.
Something choked him. The memory of the valiant
pilot was a particularly poignant one. In one sense
of the word, Stewart had become a martyr in a noble
cause. Like many another fearless flyer he had
engraved his name in blood on the flaming altar of
achievement. It was several minutes before Dick
could trust himself to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the other ships come back to our rescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Kantisepa, &ldquo;they sailed on
through the heavens and became lost in the mists of
a distant country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was strange, thought Dick. Queer the others
had not seen their fall. But surely by this time they
had discovered the absence of the third plane and
would come back to investigate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long has it been since we fell to the
ground?&rdquo; Dick inquired of Kantisepa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late yesterday afternoon. This is another day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s heart sank at the information. He had
supposed that only a few hours had passed since the
accident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you saw no sign of the ships returning?&rdquo; he
persisted. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kantisepa shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure, my brother. Even if I had not seen
them, had they returned, my ears would have caught
the sound of their coming. Perhaps they have gone
back to the land of your people, the place beyond
the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next ten or fifteen minutes the young
adventurer attempted to make his two companions,
credulous and highly imaginative Indians, understand
that there was nothing in any way magical or
mysterious about those ships of the air; and that
neither he nor his friends were gods from some
vague land beyond the rim of the world, but flesh
and blood men like themselves, men who had come
from Edmonton to bring help and relief to hundreds
of their kinsmen suffering from the plague.</p>
<p>Both Kantisepa and the chief had heard of the
existence of the big city to the south, and the name
&ldquo;Edmonton&rdquo; was not unfamiliar to them. But
neither had ever heard, or if they had heard would
have believed that ordinary mortals, even the smartest
of the white race, could fashion boats from wood
and iron that could float through thin air. Finally,
however, when Dick had nearly exhausted his
patience and his vocabulary, he saw that in a measure,
at least, they had begun to credit his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very wonderful,&rdquo; said the chief, &ldquo;that men
are now able to go floating through the skies. But
tell me, my brother, have not certain of the braver
ones already journeyed to the stars?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;Thus far no boat has
ever been built which would be strong enough to
undertake such a voyage. Perhaps that will come in
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An interval of silence ensued, broken at length by
the appearance of an Indian squaw, who brought
food and drink and placed it before the young man.
Then, while Dick ate, he talked. He told them of
the smallpox epidemic north of the Mackenzie, of his
adventures in going to Peace River Crossing at the
request of Inspector Cameron of the mounted police,
and subsequently of his ill-fated ride from Fort Vermilion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those ships of the air,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;are carrying
medicine to the sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Indians appeared to be very much interested,
offering their services in any way that would
be useful in such a cause. The chief said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will give you ponies so that you may proceed
on your journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick thanked them. &ldquo;That is very kind of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up with beaming eyes, then abruptly
his face darkened as a thought occurred to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must take the body of my friend with me,&rdquo;
he trembled. &ldquo;I must start today. The great white
father of the police will be pleased to hear of your
kindness. Perhaps some of your people will be so
good as to accompany me on my journey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The chief advanced and laid a hand benevolently
on the young man&rsquo;s head. Something closely akin
to a smile lighted the wrinkled, weatherbeaten face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I myself,&rdquo; he announced proudly, &ldquo;will lead the
expedition which will set out this afternoon for the
Mackenzie River. It is said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with a stiff, formal bow, he turned with
great dignity and strode out of the tepee.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Dick rose and followed Kantisepa
outside. They proceeded to a far end of the
village, where a poplar pole corral had been built.
This corral or compound contained between thirty or
forty Indian ponies. A number of youths had already
entered it, carrying lassos. Following much
shouting and stampeding of hoofs, they soon had a
number of the little beasts saddled and bridled in
preparation for the journey northward.</p>
<p>Kantisepa and Dick stood near the entrance of the
corral, conversing in low tones. It was during this
conversation that Dick learned for the first time that
the place where the plane had crashed to the ground
was not close to the village. This information had
come as a result of his request that he be taken
to the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said to his Indian friend, &ldquo;we will
walk over there while the young men are packing the
ponies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kantisepa stared at the other in mild disapproval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you wish to go now?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It is
far to walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six miles,&rdquo; came the astonishing reply. &ldquo;Very
soon we will go that way. The magic ship lies broken
in a little meadow that lies straight in the direction
of the noonday sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you carried me here all that way?&rdquo; Dick
asked in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is so,&rdquo; Kantisepa answered, the tone of
his voice implying that the achievement was scarcely
worthy of mention.</p>
<p>Dick looked at the stalwart Indian with something
very much like a lump in his throat. He could
see it all plainly now: The shattered airplane, himself
crawling dazedly from the wreckage, only to
sink unconscious in a place where eventually he
would have died, had not this dusky friend come to
his rescue. Impulsively he stepped forward and imprisoned
one of Kantisepa&rsquo;s long, thin hands in his
own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; his voice quavered, &ldquo;I have very
much to thank you for, and never shall I forget your
kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Not long afterward a young Indian led a pony
over to where Dick and Kantisepa stood and indicated
with a gesture that the beast belonged to
Dick. Immediately behind, came another youth with
a mount for Kantisepa. Soon the cavalcade was
formed. At two o&rsquo;clock they rode forth in the bright
glare of October sunshine.</p>
<p>As they went forward in the direction of the little
meadow, Dick was conscious of many mixed emotions.
He was glad that they had started out on the
trek to Mackenzie River, yet the thought of approaching
the shattered airplane and taking Stewart&rsquo;s
crushed body north for burial filled him with many
unhappy thoughts.</p>
<p>On they went through the beauty of a perfect
Indian Summer. The earth was languorous and quiet,
wrapped in a blue haze, made resplendent by the vari-colored
autumn foliage. Kantisepa, who was riding
close beside Dick, presently raised one arm and
pointed ahead to where the trees thinned out to form
a natural meadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be there soon,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>Dick looked, then turned his head away. He hated
the coming ordeal. With difficulty, he steeled himself
for the trying experience of approaching the battered
plane and removing Stewart from the wreckage. In
his weakened, nervous state, he felt unequal to the
task. He rode forward, eyes on the ground, feeling
sick and unhappy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>They pushed their way to the edge of the meadow,
when, suddenly as if by a common impulse, the
cavalcade checked itself and a low murmur of excitement,
mixed with fear, ran along its entire length.</p>
<p>Dick supposed that the sight of the broken plane
had been the cause of the momentary delay. However,
when he looked up, he too became excited. A
surge of happiness welled up in him. He leaned over
dazedly and grasped the pommel of his saddle.</p>
<p>Straight ahead, not far from the ruins of the craft
in which he had nearly been killed, stood two gray
airplanes, graceful as birds. They had come back to
rescue him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">THE TOLL OF THE NORTH</span></h2>
<p>Corporal Rand&rsquo;s bloodshot eyes watched the
bannock baking before the fire. It was a small bannock,
as bannocks go&mdash;a few ounces of flour, water
and salt, simmering and bubbling there in the bottom
of the frying pan. Unsupported by as much as a
single pinch of baking powder, this culinary effort
of Rand&rsquo;s wore an appearance of deep and utter dejection.
Either as a work of art or as an achievement
in cookery the thing was a failure&mdash;an unsavory, unappetizing
mess. Yet the corporal regarded it with
elation in his heart. His mouth watered and his
stomach did an acrobatic flip-flop of happy anticipation.
It was a wonderful moment for Rand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Half-starved, almost worn to the bone, in his
desperate effort to make Keechewan Mission before
the final freeze-up, the young policeman was in dire
straits. For several days now he had subsisted
chiefly on the dry and withered berries of saskatoon,
with an occasional small morsel of bird meat. For
hundreds of miles he had trekked along in worn
moccasins, flapping miserably about his ankles, the
bare soles of his feet pattering monotonously over a
rough, difficult, uncertain trail.</p>
<p>Since leaving Mackenzie River barracks one disaster
had followed another. First, he had lost his horse
and rifle in attempting to ford a difficult river. Three
days later, while he slept, there had come in the night
a soft-footed Indian prowler who had, without compunction,
stolen his only pair of service boots, his
shoulder-pack and his revolver.</p>
<p>He had been placed in a terrible predicament.
Barefooted, hungry, an unabating rage in his heart,
he had struggled on for a distance of nearly twenty
miles before luck favored him to the extent of directing
him to an Indian encampment, where he ate his
first full meal in many days and where, after many
threats and much patient dickering, he had been able
to purchase a pair of moosehide moccasins.</p>
<p>A few days following this fortunate meeting, he
had been reduced almost to his previous condition
of want and suffering. Then the tables had turned
again. Not more than an hour ago a great good fortune
had befallen him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>He had come down into a little valley between two
hills; hobbling down on tortured feet to a sizeable
grove of poplar and jack-pine. Half-cursing, half-moaning
to himself, he had crossed a low ravine,
then scrambled up in the mellow afternoon sunlight
to the edge of a small natural clearing. His incurious
gaze swept the view before him. For a moment he
paused, leaning somewhat dizzily against a small
sapling before continuing his course southward to
the Wapiti River, where he had planned to camp for
the night.</p>
<p>In the short space of time in which he stood there,
shaking with fatigue, there impressed itself presently
upon his vision an object of unusual interest.
It was the small stump of a tree&mdash;an ancient,
weather-beaten stump, probably not more than eight
or ten inches in diameter. As Rand looked at it, a
half-hearted wonderment stole over him, then a sudden
quickening of the heart. Here before him was a
man-made stump, the first he had seen in the last two
hundred miles of steady travelling through the wilderness.</p>
<p>Someone, perhaps a long time ago, had felled a
tree here. The corporal could easily make out the
imprint of an ax. And looking farther he had found
other stumps, upon which trees had once rested&mdash;about
thirty of them in all&mdash;standing there old and
rotten at the heart, like so many dreary sentinels in
an unsightly garden of desolation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Suddenly Rand gave vent to a sharp, quick cry of
excitement. In spite of the fact that his feet hurt
him almost beyond endurance, he went forward at a
run, racing over the thick dry grass. The trees had
been cut down for a purpose, as he had surmised.
He could see the cabin now, faintly showing through
the screen of underbrush on the opposite side of the
clearing.</p>
<p>But his heart fell as he came closer to the cabin.
A sickening wave of disgust and disappointment
swept over him. He could see plainly that no one
lived there. The door, partially open, hung loosely
on broken hinges, while across the threshold, the
grass had woven a tangled mat which encroached
a full twelve inches into the dark interior.</p>
<p>Years had passed probably since a human foot
had stepped within that cabin. In its present untenanted,
dilapidated state it had very little to offer to
a man whose stomach gnawed with the irrepressible
pangs of hunger. In a fit of sudden despair, he stood
and regarded it darkly.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he strode through the doorway, for
no apparent reason that he could imagine, unless it
was to satisfy a somewhat morbid curiosity as to
what he would find within. In the dim light of the
single room, he moved cautiously forward, peering
about him with half-frightened eyes. His feet stirred
up a choking dust. There was a smell about the
place he did not like. It rose to his nostrils&mdash;a faintly
sickening odor of decayed plants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>A crudely constructed cupboard at one side of the
room attracted his attention. He walked over and
examined it. The lower shelf contained nothing of
interest: a few black, dirty pots, covered with rust.
On the second shelf there was a miscellaneous assortment
of knives and forks, a small hammer with one
of the claws broken, two enamelled plates, chipped
badly, but otherwise in fair condition.</p>
<p>The policeman found it necessary to rise on tiptoes
in order to reach the third shelf at all; but after
a good deal of fumbling and groping about, his hand
came in contact with a round object, which he lifted
down for better inspection.</p>
<p>The weight of the thing, about six or seven
pounds, indicated that it was not entirely empty. It
was round and cylindrical in shape and was fitted on
the top with an air-tight cover. Rand&rsquo;s face became
damp with moisture as he turned the vessel slowly
around in his hands. He shook it several times, listening
to the dull thud inside. Then, with a quick
in-taking of breath, he placed it hurriedly on the
floor and attempted to pry off the lid.</p>
<p>Several minutes later&mdash;for the cover was rusted
down&mdash;he straightened up, gibbering inanely. His
eyes were bright with the joy of his discovery. He
laughed loudly, gleefully&mdash;a hint of madness in his
laugh. He stooped forward again, ramming one hand
into the cool, white substance. For one delicious moment
he pawed around in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flour! Flour!&rdquo; he gloated. &ldquo;This is lucky!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>And so he ate the bannock with thankfulness in
his heart. He had used very little of the flour. With
careful rationing, it would still last him a long time&mdash;perhaps
even to Keechewan Mission.</p>
<p>He sat now, staring into the fire, vaguely wondering
what the morrow would bring forth. He was in
a much happier frame of mind than he had been
for many days. Things looked brighter somehow&mdash;after
that bannock. In the morning he would build
a raft and cross the Wapiti. After that there would
be fairly smooth and open country until he came to
the Little Moose. More trouble there. A day or
two crossing the divide&mdash;then Keechewan Mission
less than thirty miles away.</p>
<p>A short time later, Rand stirred himself and
hobbled down to the river. He would bathe his aching
feet in ice-cold water before turning in. They
were in terrible condition and required immediate
attention. If only he could get the pain and fever
out of them. Tomorrow morning he would tear up
his shirt and make soft cushions to wear inside his
moccasins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>For several minutes he sat, dangling his feet in
the glistening, gurgling flood of the turbulent Wapiti.
It was so dark now that he could scarcely see. It
was chilly sitting there on the rock with a north
wind whipping across his face and the water, like ice,
around his ankles. Much as he hated to admit it, the
weather was not promising. In fact, there was an
indefinable something in the air, a vague, mysterious
portent that caused him to shiver with apprehension.</p>
<p>Suddenly, above the sound of the river and the
moaning of the wind, startled and alert, Rand heard
a splashing out in mid-stream. A moose or caribou,
was his first thought. Too bad he didn&rsquo;t have a gun.
In his half-famished state a moose-steak now
would be his salvation.</p>
<p>A human voice carried across the water. Another
voice. Rand could not credit his senses. He rose,
forgetting about his bare feet, and strained his eyes
until they hurt in the hope that he might be able to
see something. He was all atremble. It was dark
out there, dark as black midnight. The water rippled
and the wind moaned in the pines. Surely he
was mistaken about those voices. He couldn&rsquo;t hear a
thing now&mdash;not even a splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull out! You&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; too close tuh shore,&rdquo;
warned a voice, deep and resonant.</p>
<p>There was no mistaking it this time. Rand&rsquo;s heart
leaped. In the tremendous excitement of the moment
he forgot himself completely. Like one daft, he
sprang from the rock and raced wildly along the
shore, cutting his already bruised and battered feet.
He screeched at the top of his voice&mdash;one long and
prolonged screech that shattered the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yip! Yih!&rdquo; shouted Rand, waving his arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo;&mdash;from the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out! Look out! You plagued fool. Look
out! Now you&rsquo;ve done it. There!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A frenzied splashing of oars, another warning
shout&mdash;a crash! It was the crumpling impact of
wood against rock that Rand heard, followed by the
shrieks of two men in mortal terror. Experienced in
such matters, he sensed immediately what had occurred.
Sweeping down the swift, treacherous current,
the boat had veered in too close to shore, had
struck a rock and had overturned. The men were in
the water. His fault entirely. That foolish screech&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Shouting out his encouragement, the corporal
waded out into the stream and, without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation, dove forward and commenced swimming
to their rescue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">CAMERON FEELS THE STRAIN</span></h2>
<p>The advance guard of the Edmonton relief expedition
arrived at Mackenzie River two days late.
Included among its personnel were Dick Kent, Sandy
and Toma and two medical men, Drs. Brady and
Mattinson. Joy over the safe arrival of the
party was shadowed by the news of the destruction
of one of the planes and the death of Stewart,
the aviator.</p>
<p>Inspector Cameron began at once to plan two
separate itineraries into the stricken areas. One of
the physicians, it was decided, would be sent immediately
to the country north of the Mackenzie, from
whence Davis had brought first word of the
epidemic. Another party was instructed to proceed
north and east toward the barren lands, over the
selfsame route Corporal Rand had but recently taken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>It was while these preparations were being carried
out that the three boys, Dick, Sandy and Toma, were
called into the presence of the mounted police official.
Caps in hand, feeling awkward and ill at ease, they
listened to the grave and somewhat impatient voice
of the inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell you how pleased I am. Splendid!
You&rsquo;ve done well. Want to thank each one of you.
Suppose you think you&rsquo;re going home now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assertion seemed to require an answer. Sandy
twisted his cap into a knot, smiled, cleared his throat
and assumed the part of spokesman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. We are under that impression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cameron scowled, running his fingers through his
rumpled hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it! You&rsquo;re not! Might as well
disillusion you right now. You&rsquo;re to undertake another
errand, equally as important and dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to lead the way to the barren lands. Escort
to Doctor Brady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys exchanged furtive glances. Cameron
continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, I&rsquo;m placing you in charge. You&rsquo;re the
oldest. Sandy and Toma will be your lieutenants.
This expedition must not fail. Nothing must happen
to it. I&rsquo;ll hold you all responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; trembled Dick. &ldquo;But how do we get
there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no trail. I&rsquo;ll try and find a guide for you.
You proceed northeast, cross the Wapiti, the Little
Moose, pass over a height of land known as &lsquo;The
Divide,&rsquo; enter the barren lands and thus eventually
come to the Keechewan Mission, an important Catholic
missionary center. It&rsquo;s a hard trip and you&rsquo;ll
never forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there many people at this mission?&rdquo; inquired
Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a sort of village there&mdash;a mission-village:
flour mill, schools, hospital and the like.
There are always several large Indian encampments
close by. The plague has found its way there. Scores
have died. As far as I know, no other section of the
country is in such dire straits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inspector paused, scowling again and for a
moment seemed to have forgotten that he was not
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The epidemic is bad enough,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;but
to add to the horror of the situation, a revolt has
taken place among the Indians. I&rsquo;ve been compelled
to send Corporal Rand up there. You will follow
but I doubt if you will overtake him. He&rsquo;s travelling
light, while you will have medicine, supplies,
mail&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mail!&rdquo; interrupted Dick in surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mail. All of the mail for the Keechewan
Mission comes here and is forwarded, usually
through the efforts of the R. N. W. M. P. There
will be three large sacks, including one packet of
registered letters. Are you willing to undertake this
responsibility?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were a little confused and shy. For a
time no one spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you a question,&rdquo; persisted the inspector.
&ldquo;Do you or do you not want to take the mail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Dick hurriedly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be glad
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Then that&rsquo;s settled. I&rsquo;ve given you an
idea of the route. Anything you wish to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be necessary to supply us with some sort of
transport,&rdquo; Dick reminded him. &ldquo;Would you suggest
ponies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Cameron smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might suggest ponies did I not know the North
as well as I do. The season is growing late. It is
now the last week in October. The weather has been
wonderful&mdash;unusual, but we&rsquo;re due for a change almost
any day now. You&rsquo;ll have to take both ponies
and dogs. Just as soon as the first snowstorm comes,
you can turn the ponies loose and proceed with the
huskies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>A short discussion then took place. Dick could see
that the inspector was very anxious to have them
start as soon as possible. For the past few weeks the
police head had had much to worry him. That was
evident. Deep lines showed in his forehead. At
times he was subject to fits of brooding, although the
safe arrival of the Edmonton party had considerably
cheered him.</p>
<p>Burdened with so many responsibilities, Cameron
revealed his state of mind from time to time, either
by his expression or by some chance word he let fall.
Naturally, the boys supposed that the inspector&rsquo;s
chief worry had to do with the epidemic. They did
not know that one of the things that caused the
grizzled veteran of police many hours of apprehension
and nights of wakeful, intolerable anxiety was
Corporal Rand&rsquo;s hazardous undertaking. He feared
for his subordinate&rsquo;s safety. The corporal had not
been vaccinated. He had been sent to a district which
festered with the plague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rand has gone up ahead of you,&rdquo; he told the
boys. &ldquo;When you arrive at the mission, the first
thing I want you to do is to look him up. Doctor
Brady has my instructions. He&rsquo;ll vaccinate the corporal
if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off suddenly and his eyes sought his
desk. Absently he picked up a letter-file and ran
through it. Dick observed that his fingers were
trembling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t too late, Dr. Brady will vaccinate him,&rdquo;
he resumed more calmly. &ldquo;The thought of his being
up there troubles me. Shouldn&rsquo;t have gone in the
first place. Matter of fact, he went against my
wishes. Hardly in physical shape. Weak. Been
sick a long time with pneumonia. I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the police chief became absorbed in his
thoughts. The boys stood undecided, then turned and
left the room. Outside, where they would not be
overheard, Sandy broke forth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw him just like that before. I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s
losing his grip, Dick. Acts queer, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at it,&rdquo; Dick came staunchly to
the inspector&rsquo;s rescue. &ldquo;You must admit his position
has been trying enough of late. If I&rsquo;d been in his
place, I&rsquo;d be a mental wreck by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after the subject was forgotten in the hurry
and interest of their departure. All three had been
sent to Dr. Brady and were vaccinated. At three
o&rsquo;clock that same afternoon the cavalcade set out.
An Indian guide, who professed to know every foot
of the route, had been added to their train at the last
moment by Inspector Cameron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not altogether sure about this man,&rdquo; he had
told Dick in strict confidence. &ldquo;Seems intelligent
enough, and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s been over the route many
times. My only objection to him is his appearance.
But one can&rsquo;t condemn a man on that score. He&rsquo;ll
probably prove invaluable to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick glanced at the new recruit and pursed his
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he volunteer for this service?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Seemed anxious to go. Didn&rsquo;t even want
pay for his services. Rather unusual, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he has relatives or friends at Keechewan
he&rsquo;s been worrying about,&rdquo; surmised Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, that may explain it. Still, I can&rsquo;t say
I like his looks. You&rsquo;d better watch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on my guard,&rdquo; laughed Dick as he leaned
over in his saddle to shake hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my very
best, inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you will. Otherwise, I wouldn&rsquo;t have
sent you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grim mouth relaxed into a faint smile. Cameron
reached up and gripped Dick&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">THE MUTINEER</span></h2>
<p>Three days out from the mounted police detachment
the weather grew suddenly cold and the first
snow fell. Without preliminary warning, winter had
come. It swept down from the north, a mad trumpeter
blowing his blast at the head of a vengeful, icy
column. On the morning of the second day after
the storm six inches of snow covered the earth.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s first act was to remove the packs from the
ponies and place them on the dog sleighs. This task
took less than an hour. With the malemute and
husky teams transporting their supplies, they pushed
on, discovering that, despite the cold, they now made
better progress. Dick drove the mail sledge, while
Sandy and Toma had charge of the team which conveyed
most of the medicine, not to mention the
worthy and genial Dr. Brady himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Brady was popular with everyone. Always in good
spirits, he became known for his wit and humor. Although
considerably past middle age, he had never
contrived to outgrow the young man&rsquo;s viewpoint. He
felt like a boy again. He talked and laughed and
played pranks like a boy. To him this incursion into
a vast wilderness region was an experience long to
be remembered. He insisted upon doing a share of
the work, soon learned to drive a dog team and often
took his turn in breaking trail.</p>
<p>For the most part, cloudy weather prevailed, with
an occasional light snowfall. The country was new
to Dick and he was compelled to leave the charting
of their route to the guide who had joined their
party just previous to their departure.</p>
<p>The guide&rsquo;s name was Martin Lamont. He was
probably of French extraction, although he claimed
to be a full-blood Indian. For a native, his skin was
too light, his cheekbones too low, and, what was
most incredible of all, his dark hair was curly. His
nose was large and unsightly, while his lips were
thin&mdash;thin and bloodless. A slight cast in one hawk&rsquo;s
eye gave him a peculiar squint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t help being so murderous-looking, I
don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; Sandy declared one morning. &ldquo;Just
the same, that eye of his chills me to the bone whenever
he looks my way. And did you ever notice,
Dick, that horrible scar on his left cheek?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dick replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed it. But I think
I could endure his looks if only he had a more pleasant
disposition. He seldom talks. When he does, it&rsquo;s
usually a grunt or a snarl. A while ago he acted
queerly when I asked him to relieve one of the
drivers, who was breaking trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Brady was walking right behind the two boys
and evidently had been listening to their conversation,
for, at this juncture, he suddenly broke forth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did act queerly&mdash;only I think I&rsquo;d call it defiant.
There was a mutinous look in that squint eye
of his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was unprovoked,&rdquo; said Dick, a little bitterly.
&ldquo;I asked him in a friendly way. It&rsquo;s only fair that
we should all take turn in breaking trail. He&rsquo;s the
only one that seems to object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did he say?&rdquo; Sandy demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;Merely muttered
something under his breath, glared at me, then
walked back behind the last team. He&rsquo;s sulking there
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; Sandy wagged his head.
&ldquo;He volunteered his services and yet doesn&rsquo;t want
to do his part. What would you say is wrong with
him, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t properly diagnosed his case yet,&rdquo; grinned
Brady, &ldquo;although his symptoms indicate a very
serious condition. Offhand, I&rsquo;d say that he required
immediate treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may get it,&rdquo; Dick hinted darkly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Sandy laughed. &ldquo;Places you in a kind of bad position,
doesn&rsquo;t it, old chap? First thing you know,
you&rsquo;ll lose face with the rest of this outfit. That
Nitchie is setting a mighty bad example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what I think,&rdquo; appended Brady. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
in charge here, aren&rsquo;t you, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dick nodded. &ldquo;Worse luck. If it comes
to a show-down of course, I&rsquo;ll have the police behind
me. Still, I hate trouble. Sometimes I think I&rsquo;ll let
Mr. Lamont have his own way, and again I feel that
to do that will only breed discontent among the
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick turned and looked up into the physician&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re older than I am, doctor. What would you
suggest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Brady&rsquo;s brow puckered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. I hate to advise you, my
boy. You might be inclined to follow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out with it,&rdquo; Dick laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re putting me
off. What would you do if you were in my place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; said Dr. Brady, &ldquo;and I never
did. I&rsquo;ve been watching him ever since we left
Mackenzie. His actions are suspicious. His disposition
is unbearable. He&rsquo;s a hard and dirty customer.
In spite of which&mdash;if I were in your place&mdash;I think
I&rsquo;d have it out with him. But if you do, I&rsquo;m afraid
there&rsquo;ll be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean he&rsquo;ll fight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not openly. He isn&rsquo;t that type. He&rsquo;ll
wait his chance to get even. It&rsquo;s hard to say what
he&rsquo;d do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they walked on in silence. Then Dick
stepped out to one side of the trail, a grim look on
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll soon find out. I&rsquo;m going back there
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s eyes opened wide and his gaze followed
his chum as he walked back to the end of the line.
Brady chuckled. The driver of the team behind
turned his head and grinned.</p>
<p>Lamont&rsquo;s squint eye gleamed balefully as Dick
approached. Probably the man knew why Dick had
come, sensed the other&rsquo;s motive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little while ago,&rdquo; Dick spoke calmly, &ldquo;I asked
you in a nice way if you wouldn&rsquo;t help out in breaking
trail. Why didn&rsquo;t you go, Martin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo; want to go,&rdquo; grunted the miscreant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you think,&rdquo; screeched Lamont, now in a
flaming temper, &ldquo;me be guide an&rsquo; do all the work
too? I tell him Mr. Police Inspector I go show you
the way. That&rsquo;s all. No work! No break &rsquo;em
trail! Nothing! Me big fool if I go break &rsquo;em trail
like you say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Dick, endeavoring to control
himself. &ldquo;Just the same, I think you&rsquo;ll go. All day
yesterday you rode on one of the sleighs. You didn&rsquo;t
walk a mile. Is that fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; the other answered maliciously. &ldquo;Me
guide here. That&rsquo;s all I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I happen to be boss here with instructions
from the man who hired you. Either you&rsquo;ll do your
share of the work or you&rsquo;ll leave this party. Come
now, which is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me guide here,&rdquo; reiterated Lamont. &ldquo;Sorry you
no like it, but I no break trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was in a quandary. He was angry, yet also
was he nonplused. He had never encountered a situation
like this. He wasn&rsquo;t quite sure how to proceed.
He wished he had Brady at his side to advise
him. He was treading on ticklish ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, you&rsquo;ll have to leave the party, Lamont,
you understand that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin grinned across at him, a malevolent, maddening
grin. It carried a challenge. Dick&rsquo;s hand
fluttered toward the butt of his revolver, but he
caught himself in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamont, I&rsquo;m not fooling. I mean what I say.
You&rsquo;re leaving this party tonight when we make
camp. I&rsquo;ll give you enough rations to take you back
to the Mackenzie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide&rsquo;s eyes narrowed to two mere slits.
There was something venomous, snake-like in his
stare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;I no go back to the Mackenzie,&rdquo; he retorted
quickly. &ldquo;I go where I wish. That place I go is
Keechewan Mission. How you think you stop me
go there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go there, if you like, but you&rsquo;ll not go with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe not,&rdquo; said Lamont stubbornly. &ldquo;We see
about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick left the man and hurried back to the head
of the column. His face was grim and set as he
rejoined Sandy and Dr. Brady. An angry flush had
mounted to his cheeks. His fists were clenched so
hard that the nails dug into the palms of his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sandy, his voice lowered and anxious,
&ldquo;what did he say? What is he going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick could not trust himself to speak. Rage had
overcome him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show him! I&rsquo;ll show him!&rdquo; the words kept
singing through his brain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show him!&rdquo; rang
on the vengeful chant. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not make a fool of
me. Guide&mdash;paugh! I&rsquo;ll show him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, happening to glance up, he saw that Dr.
Brady was looking at him&mdash;looking at him with
friendly and yet appraising eyes. And in that moment
he felt somehow that his measure was being
taken by that genial but worldly-wise physician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He provoked me,&rdquo; said Dick by way of apology.
&ldquo;Lost my temper. He refuses to break trail, to
work&mdash;to do anything at all except just loaf around
and point out the way to Keechewan Mission.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him that I didn&rsquo;t propose to put up with
it. I said that he&rsquo;d have to go. Tonight, when we
make camp, I&rsquo;ll give him rations, send him on his
way. He&rsquo;s through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you. I think you&rsquo;re doing the right
thing,&rdquo; declared Dr. Brady. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be better off
without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could believe that,&rdquo; Sandy suddenly interjected.
&ldquo;You say we&rsquo;re better off without him&mdash;but
are we? When he leaves us, who&rsquo;ll show us
the way? Lamont is the only member of this party
who has been to Keechewan. There&rsquo;s no trail. We
can wander miles off our course, get ourselves into
all sorts of difficulties and dangers&mdash;freeze and
starve and heaven knows what. The Barrens is a
horrible place in winter, a death-trap if you don&rsquo;t
know it. My Uncle Walter has been there and he
told me about it. It makes me shiver to think about
it. Well named the Barren Lands. An eternity of
snow and utter desolation. You simply travel on
and on and on&mdash;and get nowhere. Twenty years
from now some wandering Eskimo will kick your
bleached skeleton out of his path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said Dick stubbornly. &ldquo;That man
goes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in charge here, of course. I know it&rsquo;s
hard to put up with his insolence and his bad example,
still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. Brady, who had become very
much interested in Sandy&rsquo;s point of view, &ldquo;tell us
the rest of it. I&rsquo;m very anxious to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more to tell,&rdquo; confessed the
young Scotchman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m merely asking Dick to think
this thing over very carefully before he comes to a
decision. Even if we don&rsquo;t get lost without a guide,
we&rsquo;re certain to be delayed. You know what that
means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delays mean human lives. Is that it? Is that
what you&rsquo;re thinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Inspector Cameron wants us to get through
to Keechewan as quickly as possible. It&rsquo;s important.
It&rsquo;s imperative. What if we do have to humor Lamont?
Better to let him ride every foot of the way
and lord it over us than let all those poor devils die
without a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy,&rdquo; declared Dick&mdash;and his voice caught&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
won me over. If I dismissed Lamont now
I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d have blood on my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Brady did not speak for a moment His face
was grave and thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about it?&rdquo; Dick asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A peculiar situation,&rdquo; finally admitted Brady.
&ldquo;Lamont ought to be punished, of course. He&rsquo;s a
miserable bounder, to say the least. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy&rsquo;s logic and good sense has convinced you
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to keep that guide no matter what
happens,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to keep him,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if I&rsquo;m compelled to apologize to him,&rdquo;
grimaced Dick, &ldquo;and cook his meals and wait on him
hand and foot, we&rsquo;ll have to keep him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other way. You can punish him when
you get to Keechewan, of course. I&rsquo;d suggest turning
him over to the policeman up there, your Corporal
Rand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence settled down again, broken only by the
cracking of whips and the sharp cries of the dog
drivers. The afternoon slowly wore on. An overcast
sky brought the darkness early. Yet they pushed on
for nearly an hour through the gloom before Dick
gave orders to halt and make camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made a record today,&rdquo; exulted Sandy, as
he came forward to assist Dick in unharnessing the
malemutes from the mail-sledge. &ldquo;We must have
come nearly forty miles. With a good snow-crust,
we&rsquo;ll do even better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was about to answer, when he became aware
of a form emerging from the dark. A familiar
voice accosted him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;You bet! Why hello, Toma. Where&rsquo;s your
team?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get &rsquo;em off harness already. Feed &rsquo;em fish.
Bye-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-bye they crawl in snowdrift an&rsquo; go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired enough to do that myself,&rdquo; declared Sandy.
Toma came closer. He took Dick&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that fellow, Lamont,&rdquo; he began
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he done now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tell &rsquo;em me to give you this,&rdquo; answered Toma,
placing something in Dick&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>A small, flat object of some flexible material,
which felt like leather. Dick fumbled in his pockets
for a match and struck it. The sudden tiny glare
revealed nothing more than a piece of birch bark,
blank on one side, a pencilled scrawl on the other.
Presently, with the help of another match, he made
out two words wholly unintelligible: &ldquo;god by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God by,&rdquo; asked Dick perplexedly. &ldquo;What does
that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; answered the quick-witted Sandy in
a voice that was unusually calm, &ldquo;that Lamont has
left us. Can&rsquo;t you see? Gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this thing&mdash;these words, I mean&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t spell. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;good-bye.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s gone,
I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bewildered, weary, disheartened, Dick stared miserably
out into the enveloping darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">PHANTOMS OF THE STORM</span></h2>
<p>Long before the camp was astir on the following
morning, Dick rose shivering, dressed, and made his
way to Dr. Brady&rsquo;s tent. Lamont&rsquo;s departure had
completely upset him. He could think of nothing
else. Through the long night he had lain awake
thinking unpleasant thoughts, upbraiding himself for
his lack of diplomacy and negligence. To a certain
extent he and he alone was responsible for the calamity.
He had asked Lamont to leave the party and
the guide had gone. Now he bitterly regretted the
incident. He had been a fool&mdash;rash, hasty, unthinking.
He had jeopardized the lives, not only of his
own party, but, worse still, the lives of scores of
others residing in the districts affected by the plague.</p>
<p>Hurrying along through the chill of early dawn,
it occurred to him that there might still be some
way out of the difficulty. Dr. Brady, who had not
yet been informed of the guide&rsquo;s departure, might be
able to suggest something. He entered the physician&rsquo;s
tent and proceeded to wake its occupant.
Brady sat up, for a moment stared dully about him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well! Well! So it&rsquo;s you, after all. When I
first opened my eyes here in the darkness and felt
you tugging at my arm, I was sure that my time
had come. &lsquo;Indians,&rsquo; I thought. &lsquo;Brady, you&rsquo;re
about to be scalped.&rsquo; Then I remembered that I
am bald-headed. They couldn&rsquo;t scalp me but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in trouble, doctor,&rdquo; said Dick, Brady&rsquo;s jocularity
failing to draw even a smile from him. &ldquo;Lamont
left us last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other whistled&mdash;a habit he had when surprised
or excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; the doctor brushed one
hand hurriedly across his suddenly furrowed brow,
staring straight at his informer. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you had trouble with him after all? Was
there a fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; nothing like that. I hadn&rsquo;t even talked to
him except that once. He left just when we made
camp last night. Sent me a sort of message on a
piece of birch bark. I would have given you the
news before you turned in last night if Toma and
I hadn&rsquo;t gone back on the trail to see if we couldn&rsquo;t
find the place where he&rsquo;d struck off across country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; as he spoke, Brady arose, pulling
a blanket around him. &ldquo;Too bad! Too bad! No
wonder you&rsquo;re worried, my boy. Did you sleep any
last night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; admitted Dick. &ldquo;You can imagine
how I feel. It&rsquo;s all my fault. I really told him to go.
It places us in a terrible position, doctor. I&rsquo;m not
sure whether we can find our way to Keechewan Mission
or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try,&rdquo; said Brady. &ldquo;That, at least, is a
comforting thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick removed his mittens in order to light a candle.
It was very cold inside the tent. Their breath
was like vapor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a plan,&rdquo; Dick informed the physician.
&ldquo;At first, when I heard that Lamont had left us, it
didn&rsquo;t occur to me. It may be a worthless plan. I&rsquo;d
like your opinion on it. One reason why I came over
here so early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this plan?&rdquo; asked Brady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To send Toma out to overtake and bring the
guide back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! By force?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently Brady hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. He
frowned as he began pulling on his clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if necessary, bring him back at the point
of a gun. Force him to guide us whether he wants
to or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little in doubt as to the wisdom of that.
Toma may be able to overtake Lamont and compel
him to return. But what guarantee will you have
that he&rsquo;ll guide us correctly? Don&rsquo;t you think that
there is the danger that in revenge he&rsquo;ll take us way
out of our course entirely, lead us afield? That
would be disastrous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t dare. His life would be forfeit.
I&rsquo;ll attend to that,&rdquo; said the young man grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate, it&rsquo;s worth trying. But why
don&rsquo;t you go after him yourself, Dick? Do you
think this young Indian will be as apt to find him
as you will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, more apt to. You don&rsquo;t know Toma. He&rsquo;s
a jewel. Clever tracker and all that. Courage like
a panther. He&rsquo;d succeed where I&rsquo;d fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call that a compliment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a compliment. He&rsquo;s wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brady completed dressing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything that I can do to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you will. You might waken the dog
mushers and see that breakfast is started while I
go over and consult with Toma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to remain in camp here until
your friend returns. The delay will be provoking
but of course it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had planned to have the party go on the same
as usual,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;You see, doctor, time is
precious. We can&rsquo;t afford to lose a minute. Toma
will have to take his chance. He knows the general
direction in which we are travelling and can easily
pick up our tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Dr. Brady and Dick separated just outside the
tent. The wind sent a swirl of snow about their
ankles. Already a few of the malemutes could be
seen emerging from their snowy dens or standing,
gaunt and motionless with raised muzzles, sniffing
the frosty air.</p>
<p>Toma was not only awake but had already left
his sleeping quarters and, when Dick found him,
was squatting Indian fashion in front of a roaring
spruce fire, drinking a hot cup of tea. At sight of
his chum, he put down the cup, his face lighting with
a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You up so quick,&rdquo; he greeted him. &ldquo;I thought
mebbe I only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sidewise movement of his head, Toma
indicated to Dick that he should sit down beside
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You drink &rsquo;em tea. Make you feel good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not now, Toma. I&rsquo;ll have breakfast later.
I&rsquo;ve come to see you about&mdash;about Lamont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quiet eyes surveyed Dick curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that right away when I first see you.
You no like it about Lamont run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve struck it. I don&rsquo;t. But it was partly my
fault that he left, Toma. I&rsquo;ve been wondering what
we&rsquo;ll do without a guide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We get along all right mebbe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to risk it,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;I wish Lamont
was here. He&rsquo;s lazy and worthless in lots of ways
but he knows the trail. Will you go out and bring
him back, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian lad blinked, stared at his chum unbelievingly.
Surely he didn&rsquo;t mean that. Go after
Lamont? Why the man wasn&rsquo;t worth his salt. He
broke the silence with a sudden jarring laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m in earnest,&rdquo; Dick hastened to reassure
the other. &ldquo;I really want you to go, Toma. Find
him and make him come back. You can take your
gun. You must be very careful. While you&rsquo;re out
there after him, we&rsquo;ll go on. You can follow and
overtake us later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian rose deliberately to his feet. His eyes
were sparkling now in his eagerness. No need to
tell Dick that he would meet his wishes, would be
glad of the chance for this adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t be afraid?&rdquo; Dick asked.</p>
<p>Toma grunted disdainfully, lifting his shoulders
in a gesture that implied scorn at the mere suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I start right away,&rdquo; he informed his friend.
&ldquo;Mebbe you be surprised how soon I bring him back.
Him lazy fellow. Not go very far before he stop
an&rsquo; rest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit. I know you&rsquo;ll succeed, Toma.&rdquo;
Dick rose and placed one arm affectionately about
the broad shoulders, a great weight lifted from his
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be gone in a few minutes. You say good-bye
Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Lots of luck, odd chap. Don&rsquo;t get
into any trouble. If I were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t take
any chances with Lamont either. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken,
he&rsquo;s more treacherous than a wolf. You&rsquo;ll
have to watch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be careful&mdash;don&rsquo;t you worry. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And not long afterward the young Indian stole
silently forth on his dangerous errand. Expert in
the use of snowshoes, he seemed to glide away, his
queer shuffling motion taking him quickly across the
open space to a clump of trees beyond. When Dick
had joined Dr. Brady and Sandy and the little group
around the campfire, he had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope he&rsquo;s successful,&rdquo; Sandy sighed, picking up
another armful of wood to throw on the fire.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve shown good judgment in sending him,
Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not a very pleasant morning,&rdquo; said Dr.
Brady.</p>
<p>Dick glanced at the lowering sky, at the black
clouds rolling up from the horizon and nodded
grimly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the worst part of it, if we should
have a blizzard Toma might as well come back.
He&rsquo;d lose Lamont&rsquo;s tracks and could never find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in a storm,&rdquo; agreed Sandy. &ldquo;It would be
almost impossible. But let&rsquo;s hope that that won&rsquo;t
happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet happen it did. They were out on the trail
by that time, mushing slowly along the edge of a
wide ravine, their faces toward the wind, which was
very sharp and penetrating. The loose snow, covering
the drifts, was awhirl by now, sweeping around
them. Yet this preliminary barrage was as nothing
compared to the terrific onslaught that followed.
A fearful darkness descended over the earth, for
the light was smothered as the snow gods hurled their
challenge.</p>
<p>Dick and his party did the only thing possible
under the circumstances. They blindly sought out
the nearest shelter and clung there, helpless and as
impotent as babes, mere human specks in a tremendous
vortex of wind and snow. Night had fallen
when finally the sky cleared. Everywhere around
them were mountainous drifts, battlements, peaks
and even pinnacles, showing white and ghostly in
the pale starlight.</p>
<p>As the little party straggled forth from its shelter,
the earth presented an aspect of strangeness, of newness,
so entirely different from its original appearance,
that one could almost believe that he had been
transported in some mysterious manner to another
world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;I honestly believe,&rdquo; Sandy gasped, &ldquo;that all the
snow in the universe has been gathered together and
dropped down in this one place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks like it,&rdquo; agreed Dr. Brady,
as he took a step forward and slid waist-deep into
a drift. &ldquo;How are we going to break trail? I certainly
pity your friend Toma. Do you think it will
be wise to push on until we hear from him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick shook his head despondently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ll have to wait here. This storm is the
worst thing that could have happened. Toma may
not be able to rejoin us for two or three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If not longer,&rdquo; despaired Sandy.</p>
<p>So, imagine their surprise and delight on the following
morning to find the young man in question
already amongst them. Toma sauntered up with
solemn unconcern to the place where Dick and Sandy
were endeavoring to build a fire. No apparition
could have astonished them more. From their squatting
position, they looked up and gasped, then rose in
unison, howling like two maniacs. They descended
upon the young Indian with a varied assortment
of whoops and yells, lifted him up bodily between
them and carried him triumphantly away to the tent
of Dr. Brady.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; shouted Sandy. &ldquo;Look what we&rsquo;ve
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe, doctor,&rdquo; screeched Dick.</p>
<p>The center of so much interest and enthusiasm,
one would have thought that Toma himself would
have caught some of the infection. Not so. With
each passing moment, his face became more and
more gloomy, his manner more despondent. He
struggled out of Dick&rsquo;s and Sandy&rsquo;s embarrassing
embrace to a more dignified position on his feet.
Soberly he waved them aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think mebbe I bring back Lamont,&rdquo; he said
bitterly. &ldquo;It is not so. I no see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With averted eyes and shamed, flushed face, he
pushed the two boys unceremoniously to one side and
stalked sombrely outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">A HUNGRY PROWLER</span></h2>
<p>For three hours Dick had been breaking-trail
steadily and had reached the point where his endurance
was spent, where it seemed to him that to
take one more step would result in physical collapse.
Behind him straggled a perspiring, panting line of
weary dogs and wearier men, while ahead&mdash;snow;
acre upon acre, mile upon mile, interminable, never-ending&mdash;snow!</p>
<p>The sun of late afternoon shone brightly on the
snow and made of it a vast, brilliant, sparkling field
of intolerable whiteness. To gaze for any length of
time into that field was impossible. The human eye
wavered before that blinding radiance, could not
for long meet and hold its glaring intensity. So it
was that Dick looked down as he staggered on at the
head of the column, and so it was that every other
member of the party moved forward with bent head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>They were travelling northeast in the general direction
of Keechewan Mission. Keechewan Mission
was at the end of an imaginary straight line&mdash;a very
straight line&mdash;beginning at the Mackenzie River
barracks. Sometimes, because of topographical obstructions&mdash;hills,
ravines, dense forests, and the like&mdash;the
party was forced to deviate or detour from
the prescribed route. Naturally this wandering
brought confusion. No one knew with any degree
of certainty whether, when they came back and attempted
to get on the right track again, they were
a little east or a little west or directly upon that imaginary
line.</p>
<p>It was a problem that would have absorbed the
interest of a navigator or a civil engineer. To Dick,
however, it was a hopeless tangle&mdash;blindly guessing
at something and hoping it would come out all right.
More and more he fell to consulting other members
of the party, especially Toma, who had a strong sense
of direction, and who had been uncannily successful
in guiding Dick and Sandy on previous expeditions.</p>
<p>He was thinking of all this as he plodded wearily
along. Perhaps even now they were off the trail
and would eventually come to grief in some forbidding
wasteland, far from the haunts of men.</p>
<p>He heard footsteps behind him and felt the weight
of a hand upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;you break trail all time. You go back
now an&rsquo; drive &rsquo;em my team an&rsquo; ride a little while
mebbe. Too hard break trail an&rsquo; no stop an&rsquo; rest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>It was Toma, of course. Always faithful and observing.
A ready champion and trusted friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good of you,&rdquo; Dick said wearily. &ldquo;I am
tired. My eyes hurt too. This glare is terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It very bad,&rdquo; agreed the young Indian. &ldquo;One
dog driver back there,&rdquo; he pointed, &ldquo;him almost
snow-blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you told me. Tonight when we make camp,
I&rsquo;ll send him to Dr. Brady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick stepped to one side to permit Toma to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, you&rsquo;ll take my place. But have
I been going right, Toma? Don&rsquo;t you think we
ought to turn more to the left? I can&rsquo;t imagine
why it is, why I feel that way, I mean, but I keep
thinking that we&rsquo;re striking too far east.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I guess you go about right. Mebbe it no
hurt to turn little more to left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick vaguely wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you believe our course is about right?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; returned Toma, &ldquo;I tell you. In morning
an&rsquo; at night when you look off that way,&rdquo; Toma
made a sweeping motion with one arm, &ldquo;you see
&rsquo;em big hill. We go towards that. We keep hill
in front of us. If we go wrong on trail, big hill be
one side or other&mdash;not in front. That&rsquo;s how I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hill,&rdquo; said Dick, puzzled. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen any.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you not look very good. Mebbe you not
look right time. Morning early, before sun him get
too bright, you see &rsquo;em plain. Jus&rsquo; before sunset
another good time. Tonight you try it an&rsquo; see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Dick, as he turned back to drive
Toma&rsquo;s team. &ldquo;You may depend upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, just before sunset, he called an early halt and
while the other members of the party unharnessed
the teams and proceeded to make supper, he climbed
to the crest of a small hill and gazed off towards
the northeast. Shadows had already commenced to
appear along the hollows and ridges. There was no
glare over the snow now. He could see for miles
across that forsaken, desolate land.</p>
<p>Yet at first he could see nothing that resembled a
hill. Where the horizon began, it was true, there
reposed what looked like a bank of mist, but which,
unlike mist, remained perfectly stationary and unchanging
in form&mdash;a sort of purplish blotch against
the blue background of the sky.</p>
<p>This, he decided, must be the hill Toma referred
to. It didn&rsquo;t look like one to his inexperienced eyes,
yet hill it must be. The young Indian had good eyesight
and a vast knowledge of the North stored away
in that clever brain of his. At any rate, provided it
didn&rsquo;t disappear during the night, he would use that
hill or blotch, or whatever it was, as the goal for tomorrow&rsquo;s
weary trek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>He returned to find supper waiting for him. The
dog mushers sat huddled around the blazing campfires,
resting after their arduous day. Dick was glad
that he had called a halt earlier than usual. The
physical strain of tramping hour after hour through
soft, yielding drifts had been almost unendurable.</p>
<p>Usually after the evening meal, Dick remained beside
the campfire to talk with Sandy and Dr. Brady,
but tonight he felt too tired. After he had eaten,
he bade his friends good-night and repaired to his
tent, where he was soon lost in sleep.</p>
<p>When he awakened, a blue darkness still enveloped
the earth. It was very early. He had a vague notion
that he had been disturbed. Somewhere at the back
of his consciousness was the dim memory of voices
and running footsteps. But whether this was reality
or a fragment of some vivid dream, he could not say.
He lay still for a few minutes, listening.</p>
<p>Satisfied, at length, that he had heard nothing, that
it was all an illusion, he turned on his side and attempted
to go back to sleep. Just then there broke
across his hearing, unusually clear and distinct, a
shrill human cry. The cry was followed by the
sound of a struggle and a muffled groan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>In a flash, Dick was up and fumbling for a candle.
He tore into his clothes. He sprang to the tent opening
and darted through&mdash;coatless, hatless, a revolver
gripped firmly in his right hand. He made his way
quickly toward the sound of struggling, arriving
just as two men swayed to their feet and seized each
other in another desperate embrace.</p>
<p>In the darkness, it was impossible to tell who the
two combatants were. For the life of him, Dick could
not guess their identity. However, he advanced,
gun held in readiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it! Stop it, I say. I have you covered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two figures drew apart. Dick wondered if
they weren&rsquo;t two of his own dog drivers, between
whom ill-feeling existed, and who were employing
this method to settle their differences. Imagine his
surprise when the voice of Toma broke the quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick! You!&rdquo; he puffed. &ldquo;This fellow he put
up pretty good fight. Twice he almost get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who is it?&rdquo; Dick asked wonderingly. &ldquo;Who
is it, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamont,&rdquo; answered the young Indian briefly.</p>
<p>Dick took a step forward and almost dropped his
gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamont!&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;Lamont! Lamont! It
can&rsquo;t be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Toma stubbornly. &ldquo;Pretty soon you
find out. You see I tell you right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what in the name of&mdash;&rdquo; Dick began, then
paused breathless. &ldquo;Lamont&mdash;what&rsquo;s he doing here?
How did you happen to find him, Toma? What
were you fighting about?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wake up over there in tent,&rdquo; Toma explained,
&ldquo;when I hear something go by. First I think mebbe
it one of the huskies. Then I hear more noise out
by my sledge. I dress quick as I can an&rsquo; go out there.
No gun!&mdash;nothing! An&rsquo; I find him this thief try
to steal. Soon as he hear me, he start run over here,
near your tent. I grab him by shoulder, but he slip
away again. More run. Again I catch him. I trip
him down an&rsquo; grab him by his throat. Then he
make yell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done well, Toma,&rdquo; Dick complimented
him. &ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned upon the panting culprit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty glad you&rsquo;ve come back. Very kind of
you. This is a pleasure we hadn&rsquo;t expected,&rdquo; he
could not conceal, even in this attempt at sarcasm,
the satisfaction and relief the guide&rsquo;s coming had
brought. He seized Lamont by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step lively now over to that tent. You&rsquo;ve played
your last little game with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flourishing his gun, he sent the former guide staggering
ahead with a well-directed push.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in there,&rdquo; he thundered, &ldquo;and be quick about
it! We&rsquo;ll have a pleasant little talk&mdash;you and I.
There are a few things I want to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>He followed Lamont inside, motioning to Toma to
follow him. In the feeble light of the single fluttering
candle eagerly he scanned the downcast features
of the man who had caused him so much misery and
trouble. He pointed to his bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he glowered, then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing here? Why did you come
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide looked up, his squint eye gleaming defiantly,
his mouth quivering with suppressed anger
and humiliation.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo; shouted Dick.</p>
<p>Lamont&rsquo;s eyes fell before the young leader&rsquo;s unblinking
gaze. His fingers played nervously with
the worn fringe of his short fur coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; stormed Dick, &ldquo;it will go hard
with you. Why did you come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get lonesome,&rdquo; lied Lamont. &ldquo;I get lonesome
all time out there alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very pretty story,&rdquo; laughed Dick. &ldquo;You come
back in the middle of the night because you were
lonesome. You didn&rsquo;t come back, of course, to steal.
Getting hungry, weren&rsquo;t you? Thought you&rsquo;d come
over and sample our supplies. Well, you failed.
You&rsquo;re a thief, Lamont, a dirty thief, and when we
arrive at Keechewan I&rsquo;ll turn you over to Corporal
Rand of the mounted police. How&rsquo;ll you like that,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>At mention of the dreaded name, the guide stirred
uneasily. He looked up again, his features distorted
with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I no help I come back,&rdquo; his voice broke. &ldquo;What
else I do? I get hungry like you say. You owe me
money. What hurt I come here an&rsquo; get little something
to eat, get mebbe few dollars grub. Anyway,&rdquo;
he hurried on, &ldquo;you tell me no want me here. You
say go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, of course, was perfectly true. Dick had
told Lamont that his services were no longer
required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I told you. But you had no right to come
back here to steal. Now you&rsquo;ll be punished for it.
You&rsquo;ll remain with this party, Lamont. You&rsquo;ll work.
You&rsquo;ll break trail. You&rsquo;ll guide us. I&rsquo;ll watch you
close, and there&rsquo;ll be a bullet for you if you try to
escape. You won&rsquo;t have an easy time of it like
you had before, Lamont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide did not answer. He merely sat and
glared at his accuser. He was nervous and ill at
ease. Dick consulted his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s now four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he announced to Toma.
&ldquo;Everyone will be awake in two hours. We might
as well stay up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma rose to his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;I take this fellow over to my tent,&rdquo; he said winking
at his chum. &ldquo;Him hungry, very hungry, he
say. All right, we make him start to work. He
get himself big breakfast. Get breakfast for you,
me too. Start campfire. Do plenty work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a bad idea. I&rsquo;ll go over with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He motioned to Lamont to follow the young Indian
outside, then remained behind for a moment
to blow out the candle. A short time later, they
stood around while Lamont worked.</p>
<p>The guide offered no objections. He was hungry,
so hungry indeed, that he would have worked gladly
for hours for a mere crust.</p>
<p>Lamont, Toma and Dick were sitting around the
fire at breakfast when the camp awoke. Here and
there a light flickered through the gloom. The plaintive
howling of the malemutes and huskies. Drowsy
human voices. The sharp, quick blows of an ax,
crackling brush. Ruddy flames leaping up, brighter
and brighter. More noise and bustle and confusion.</p>
<p>They were still sitting there, when Dr. Brady and
Sandy appeared. The pair of them came up, laughing,
but, at sight of Lamont wolfing his food, they
paused in sheer wonderment.</p>
<p>Dick beckoned to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, doctor. Don&rsquo;t hesitate, Sandy.
Come on over. He&rsquo;s perfectly harmless. Permit me
to introduce him to you. Gentlemen,&rdquo; he grinned,
&ldquo;Mr. Martin Lamont&mdash;our guide!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">THE LONE CABIN</span></h2>
<p>The days that followed proved arduous for the
guide. No longer, in lordly, domineering manner,
was he permitted to ride on one of the sledges and
point out the way. His hours of leisure were at
an end. He took his turn in breaking trail, drove
dogs, chopped wood, assisted in putting up and taking
down the tents, and in many other ways became
a useful and valuable member of the expedition.</p>
<p>His presence, distasteful as it was, had brought a
quick change in the spirits of the party. Hope rose
again in Dick&rsquo;s heart, and his enthusiasm and energy
were unbounded. He had ceased to worry about
getting lost or even wandering from the trail.
Threatened with the most dire punishment, Lamont
was forced to set their course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Shortly after the return of the guide, they came
upon the first log cabin they had seen since leaving
Mackenzie River. It stood in a thick clump of trees,
and had been recently built judging from the freshly-scored
logs and its general appearance of newness.
A flutter of interest, not unmixed with awe and
wonderment and curiosity, stirred the party. Necks
craned suddenly, drivers deserted their teams to go
forward to talk to other drivers, even the huskies
raised their tawny heads, as if to sniff out this new
mystery.</p>
<p>In the lead at the time, breaking trail, Sandy gave
the cabin the benefit of one swift look of appraisement,
then started forward on the run. He proceeded
very rapidly for fifty or sixty yards, then
stopped short so abruptly that the point of one snowshoe
became entangled in the other and he fell headlong.</p>
<p>Dick and Dr. Brady both started to laugh, but the
sound died on their lips. They watched Sandy rise
and start back, waving his arms frantically. The
driver of the first team pulled up short. The second
team, close behind the first, also pulled up short, but
not soon enough to prevent an entanglement, which
led to a furious fight among the malemutes.</p>
<p>Dick and Dr. Brady ran to the driver&rsquo;s assistance,
reaching the scene of trouble just a moment before
Sandy arrived breathless. White-lipped, the young
Scotchman waited until the commotion had subsided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Brady,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I guess you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words trailed off to a mumbling incoherence.
He sat down on the sledge, gesturing a little wildly,
his expression difficult to describe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he inquired in horror-struck tones,
&ldquo;I say, did you see&mdash;see it, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Brady nodded gravely. Dick stared, moistening
his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A red flag,&rdquo; said the physician. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t
quite sure. There was something there just outside
fluttering&mdash;&mdash; A cloth. A rag of some sort.
Looked red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Sandy spoke tersely with a deep intake
of breath. &ldquo;Smallpox!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smallpox!&rdquo; Dick echoed the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go over,&rdquo; announced Dr. Brady quite calmly.
&ldquo;Get my case, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The case was brought. The physician took it
smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go with you?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it isn&rsquo;t necessary. You&rsquo;d better stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news quickly spread. Smallpox! Faces grew
gray and anxious. One by one, the drivers slunk
back to their places, while all talk ceased.</p>
<p>Finally, Sandy jerked his hand back in the direction
of the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see lots of that sort of thing before we return
to the Mackenzie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when we get to Keechewan. But I doubt if
we&rsquo;ll find another smallpox case this side of the Barrens,&rdquo;
said Dick. &ldquo;Terrible business, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Both, as if by a common impulse, looked up and
stared over at the cabin. The red cloth fascinated
them. It furled and fluttered softly, yet ominously,
in the light breeze.</p>
<p>The boys wondered what Dr. Brady was doing.
He had entered the cabin, closing the door after
him. They both started as the door opened and their
friend emerged. They saw him raise one arm, beckoning
them to come closer. A little fearfully, Dick
and Sandy obeyed. They were strangely excited.
Stalking up before the door, they observed that the
physician was very grave indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Dick, the first one to speak.</p>
<p>Brady stepped away from the door and came toward
them, his eyes evasive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing to do,&rdquo; he announced in
a curiously soft and gentle voice. &ldquo;Set fire to the
cabin. We&rsquo;re too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late?&rdquo; repeated Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how many inside there?&rdquo; whispered Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two half-breed trappers&mdash;one young and one
old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they both had it?&rdquo; the boys asked in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dr. Brady&rsquo;s mouth twitched at the corners.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone. We came too late. As I just said,
there&rsquo;s only one thing to do: Set fire to the cabin.
Burn it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burn it,&rdquo; asked Sandy. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of precaution. To protect the lives
of others. Now and again, some lone wanderer
might chance this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Dick stood looking at the physician
during an odd interval of silence. Of course, he knew
best. They realized that. And it would save time.
Dick touched Sandy&rsquo;s shoulder and together the two
friends moved toward the timber at the back of the
house. They carried dry bark and branches, soon
gathering a large pile, which they threw down in
front of the door. Soon a fire was started. It mounted
slowly at first, smouldering and cracking, but
presently it leaped up, quickly spreading to every
part of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; Sandy sighed relievedly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a little awkward joining the party again.
Yet no one questioned them. They were greeted
with curious stares and frightened glances. At noon
they were miles away and halted for a midday meal
in the shelter of a spruce grove, through which there
ran the wandering course of a tiny stream.</p>
<p>It occurred to Dick that this stream might be one
of the tributaries of the Wapiti River, which they
must cross ere long. He was discussing this possibility
with Toma, shortly after lunch, when Sandy
came up shaking his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty business! A pretty business!&rdquo; he muttered,
taking a place beside them. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re as frightened
as sheep. Too bad we had to come across
that cabin. Hope nothing serious grows out of
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick turned and looked toward the place Sandy
indicated. The dog drivers were assembled there in
an excited, gesticulating group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I overheard part of it,&rdquo; said Sandy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
telling each other that they don&rsquo;t want to go on,
that they&rsquo;re afraid, that no white man&rsquo;s medicine
can save them from the horror of the plague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all of them have been vaccinated,&rdquo; Dick protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. But they don&rsquo;t realize what that means.
They have guessed, somehow, that the men who lived
in that cabin died. They know the meaning of that
red cloth, and it has struck terror into their hearts.
I heard Fontaine say that he, for one, intended to
turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mere talk,&rdquo; objected Dick. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get over it.
The thing is fresh in their minds now and, of course,
they&rsquo;re worried. By tomorrow or the next day
they&rsquo;ll have forgotten all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so. I can&rsquo;t help feeling that in
some way Lamont is at the bottom of this. He&rsquo;s
stirring them up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Dick stared moodily into
the fire. &ldquo;Come to think about it, I saw Lamont
talking to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sandy, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better watch him. And
the others, too. You know what it will mean if
they decide to leave us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s face shadowed, then brightened quickly.
Such a possibility seemed remote. Surely, they&rsquo;d do
nothing of the kind. They wouldn&rsquo;t dare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll soon forget,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But in this, as it subsequently proved, he was mistaken.
That night a deputation came to him. The
face of each of the drivers was set and determined.
Altogether they were an ominous crew. They gathered
around him and abruptly Fontaine, who acted
as their spokesman, spoke up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;sieur Dick, these fellow,&rdquo; indicating his following,
&ldquo;they tell me no want to go any farther.
No want to die. Smallpox get &rsquo;em sure. You know
that. You know everybody die pretty soon jus&rsquo;
like them fellow in cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all vaccinated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fontaine shook his head with great emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good that. Nothing stop smallpox. Very
bad. Make &rsquo;em all die, these fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know better yourself, Fontaine. You
know that isn&rsquo;t true. We&rsquo;re all safe enough. Tell
them not to worry. They need not be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>A mutter of defiance ran around the little circle.
Fontaine&rsquo;s voice rose to a higher pitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good tell &rsquo;em that. They understand what
you say. They know better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was rapidly losing ground. In desperation,
he raised one arm, calling for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait! Just wait!&rdquo; he beseeched them. &ldquo;I
will bring the white doctor to you and he will explain.
Dr. Brady will repeat what I have told you.
There is no danger. If you do not believe me, surely
you will believe him. He is a great medicine man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doctor him very much mistake,&rdquo; a new
voice broke into the discussion.</p>
<p>Turning quickly, Dick perceived Lamont standing
at his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who asked <i>you</i> for <i>your</i> opinion?&rdquo; Dick demanded
hotly. &ldquo;Lamont, keep out of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide&rsquo;s defective left eye rolled up in a way
that made Dick shiver. The man stepped back, leering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamont know all about this,&rdquo; Fontaine cut in
quickly. &ldquo;He tell me his father, two brothers die
from smallpox four years ago. White doctor him
there, too. Try help. No good. What you say
about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had nothing to say. It was a lie, of course,
A story to feed these frightened and credulous fools.
He could see the purpose in it all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you another thing,&rdquo; Fontaine took up the
thread of his plaint, now speaking triumphantly.
&ldquo;One of these fellows,&rdquo; he pointed to a half-breed,
who stood directly opposite, &ldquo;think mebbe already he
get sick. All afternoon his head hurt. Him feel
very hot&mdash;deezzy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo; grunted Dick. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the smallpox.
He wasn&rsquo;t within three hundred yards of the cabin.
And even if he were exposed, he wouldn&rsquo;t get sick
less than ten hours later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the drivers were obdurate. Sandy, Toma,
and later, Dr. Brady himself took turns in pleading
and arguing with them, but to no avail. Fontaine
insisted that one of their party had already contracted
the disease, so the physician examined the
man while the rest of the drivers went to their tents.
Outside Brady&rsquo;s tent, Dick, Sandy and Toma waited
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Sandy, when the doctor finally appeared,
&ldquo;what is your verdict?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure yet,&rdquo; answered the physician.
&ldquo;But the symptoms are&mdash;smallpox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can that be? He&rsquo;s vaccinated,&rdquo; Dick protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, on several different occasions, but the vaccine
took no effect. There are cases like that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Dick moved over to one of the sledges, too discouraged
and alarmed to trust himself to speak. For
several minutes he stood, gazing off across the white
bleak waste of snow and wilderness. Back near one
of the campfires, the drivers had come together again
to discuss the all-important topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see what we&rsquo;re up against, doctor,&rdquo; Dick
turned suddenly. &ldquo;If they won&rsquo;t listen to reason,
we&rsquo;re beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; echoed Sandy, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re beaten. Licked.
We can&rsquo;t go on without drivers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The situation may not be quite as serious as you
think,&rdquo; he attempted to cheer them. &ldquo;Before morning
they&rsquo;ll probably change their minds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">OUTWITTED</span></h2>
<p>Dr. Brady broke off a twig from a branch above
his head and sat down on the sledge near Dick, commencing
to trace queer patterns in the new, loose
snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will soon be time to start on again, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
asked the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s eight-thirty,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;We should
have started a half hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not try taking a firmer hand with them,&rdquo;
suggested Brady. &ldquo;Tell them that if they won&rsquo;t
go on with the party, they can return without supplies.
That ought to frighten them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try it,&rdquo; Dick fell in with the suggestion.
&ldquo;Come on. We must do something. I want you
fellows to back me up. Maybe there&rsquo;ll be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The drivers were still arguing amongst themselves
as the four approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fontaine, come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spokesman drew away from his fellow conspirators.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, M&rsquo;sieur Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the others to harness the dogs. It&rsquo;s time to
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fontaine&rsquo;s eyes sought the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They no go, m&rsquo;sieur,&rdquo; he declared doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they intend to do?&rdquo;&mdash;brusquely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. They say go back to Mackenzie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Utter nonsense. You&rsquo;ll never make it. It&rsquo;s
hundreds of miles south of here. You&rsquo;ll starve before
you get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starve!&rdquo; exclaimed Fontaine. &ldquo;But, M&rsquo;sieur
Dick, you mus&rsquo; be mistake. You have plenty grub
here. Fellows no go back without grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what they&rsquo;ll have to do if they
leave this party&mdash;everyone of them. You&rsquo;ll get nothing
from me. I&rsquo;ll shoot the first man that makes an
attempt to take anything with him. Do you understand,
Fontaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spokesman blinked and backed away. Here
was a turn of events neither he nor any of the others
had anticipated. It made their position somewhat
untenable. It required careful consideration&mdash;more
discussion. Quickly he turned and broke forth in
Cree. It volleyed from him. He punctuated his
talk with rapid-fire gestures.</p>
<p>When he had completed his oration, a deep silence
fell. It was an angry silence. The half-breed drivers
glowered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s your decision?&rdquo; Dick spoke sharply.</p>
<p>Fontaine was coldly deliberate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We eight men against four. We no go on. Fellows
get supplies an&rsquo; start back to Fort Mackenzie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was astounded. He looked up appealingly
at Dr. Brady, his pulses quickening. He observed
that Sandy&rsquo;s hands trembled. A sudden movement
among the dog drivers attracted his attention. All
of them had started forward menacingly, then as
quickly fell back. For a brief moment Dick wondered
at this hesitancy on their part, but catching
sight of Toma, the truth of the situation flashed over
him. That young man stood, fondling an ugly-looking
revolver, his eyes defying them to come on.</p>
<p>Sandy was quick to see their temporary advantage,
and he, too, whipped out his gun. The mutinous dog
drivers attempted to slink away, but Dick perceived
their little ruse and stopped them peremptorily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t. Stay right where you are until
I relieve you of your guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three of the men carried revolvers, while all of
them possessed knives. He quickly secured all these,
placing them on one of the sleighs. Then, while
Sandy and Toma kept the men covered, he and Dr.
Brady hurried over to the tents and sledges, returning
with three rifles and four more revolvers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite an arsenal,&rdquo; puffed Dr. Brady.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they won&rsquo;t get them back either,&rdquo; Dick
retorted. &ldquo;Without arms, they&rsquo;ll be helpless. During
the day while we&rsquo;re traveling, I&rsquo;ll keep them on
my sledge with the mail, and at night in my tent with
a guard posted. That means we&rsquo;ll have to take turn,
the four of us, at sentinel duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Placing their load of weapons on Dick&rsquo;s sledge,
they rejoined Sandy and Toma, who still guarded
the mutineers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can put away your guns,&rdquo; ordered Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about these prisoners?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;ll be willing to go back to their teams
now. Is it not so, Fontaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stalwart French half-breed pretended not to
hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fontaine,&rdquo; Dick raised his voice, &ldquo;did you hear
what I said? You can all go now. Take up your
tents, harness your dogs the same as usual, and get
ready to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog drivers were at a disadvantage and they
knew it. There was nothing to do but to obey. Yet
it was with much muttering and grumbling, that they
turned again to their morning&rsquo;s routine. They would
bide their time. The boys had gained the upper hand
now, but this was only the first round in a battle of
wits. Tomorrow, perhaps, they might be the victors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to watch them day and night,&rdquo; Sandy
declared, shoving the revolver back in its holster and
turning away. &ldquo;Heaven help us, if they ever get
a chance at those guns again&mdash;or those deadly-looking
knives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Dr. Brady, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like their looks.
Naturally, they&rsquo;ll resent this. I think that we can
expect trouble. I&rsquo;ll volunteer for the first night&rsquo;s
guard duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s splendid of you, doctor,&rdquo; Dick smiled.
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll let you off easy. You can stand guard
from eight until twelve tonight, and I&rsquo;ll take your
place for the remaining hours until morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first day, following the events narrated above,
passed without incident. On the second day, however,
the driver, whom Fontaine said had contracted
smallpox, and whom Dr. Brady later had examined,
died suddenly. The morale of the party tottered.
If ever the half-breeds had placed any faith in the
medicine of the white man, they lost it now. Again
they became panic stricken. The muttering and the
complaining broke out afresh. Hourly, it grew more
and more difficult to keep them at their work. Dick
found it necessary to have either Sandy or Toma
drive the last team in the line, with instructions to
be ever on the alert, their revolvers always in readiness.</p>
<p>That night, fearing trouble, Sandy, whose turn it
was to stand guard for the first part of the night,
asked Dick to keep him company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind, old chap. The truth is,
I&rsquo;m a little bit afraid. I have a feeling that the time
is nearly at hand for them to strike. I don&rsquo;t like
the way they&rsquo;ve been acting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re up to something.
They gather about in little groups, whispering. Fontaine
and Lamont keep stirring them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their first move,&rdquo; reasoned Sandy, &ldquo;will be to
try to get back their rifles and cartridges. With these
in their possession, they&rsquo;ll be able to take what supplies
they want and return to Mackenzie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sorry day for them if they do,&rdquo; Dick declared.
&ldquo;Inspector Cameron will know how to deal with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, that is true. But they don&rsquo;t stop to
think about that. Their chief worry now is to get
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As usual, the mail and guns were taken to Dick&rsquo;s
tent, where the two boys stood guard. This constant
vigilance was wearing upon them. The three boys
and Dr. Brady suffered from lack of sleep, yet each
day they were compelled to carry on. There was no
help for it.</p>
<p>Despite Sandy&rsquo;s presentiment, no attack was made
that night, nor yet on the following day. Late in
the afternoon, while crossing a low chain of hills,
they perceived, about a quarter of a mile away, a
small Indian encampment, consisting of four lonely
tepees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;There may be smallpox there,&rdquo; said Dr. Brady.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better go over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Sandy and Toma behind to watch the
camp during their absence, Dr. Brady and Dick
went forward to investigate. They were received
warmly at the first tepee, and were informed that no
one was ill. In fact, the Indians had not even heard
of the epidemic. At each of the tepees in turn they
were received graciously until they came to the fourth
and last.</p>
<p>Here their reception was very cool indeed. The
place was occupied by an aged Indian couple and by
a young man, evidently their son. This young man
became very angry upon their entrance. He sat
opposite the entrance, blankets wrapped around him,
and scowled continuously. When Dick questioned
him, he refused to answer, pretending that he did
not understand. The old Indian squaw seemed to
be the only one equipped with vocal powers. Over
and over, she kept repeating the words in English:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go &rsquo;way! Go &rsquo;way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to be very popular here,&rdquo; grinned Dr.
Brady. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no use of staying very long.
I&rsquo;ll vaccinate them as quickly as I can and then we&rsquo;ll
be on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Yet when Dr. Brady opened his medicine case and
attempted to vaccinate them, they repulsed him
stoutly. They were afraid of the doctor. His instruments
frightened them. It was evident that they
believed that his ministrations were for no other
purpose than to subject them to some new and mysterious
torture. Finally, the young Indian rose threateningly
and commanded them to depart.</p>
<p>As he did so, Dick drew back in surprise. The
Indian wore boots, heavy top-boots&mdash;the service
boots of the Royal Mounted Police&mdash;and, what was
even more astonishing, a service revolver in its holster
at his side. For a full moment he stared at the
tell-tale articles, scarcely believing his eyes. Where
had the Indian secured these things? Certainly not
from the police&mdash;unless they had been taken by force
or stolen. Dick&rsquo;s arm trembled as he took Dr.
Brady&rsquo;s arm and pulled him toward the entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, doctor, we&rsquo;d better get out of here.
It&rsquo;s no use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside the tepee, he turned quickly upon his companion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, doctor, did you notice what that young Indian
wore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Dr. Brady, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice particularly.
Moosehide garments, weren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. No. The boots, I mean&mdash;the revolver!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did have boots. Rather queer, isn&rsquo;t it?
They usually wear moccasins.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Usually wear moccasins!&rdquo; exploded Dick. &ldquo;Why
those were mounted police boots. They&rsquo;re different.
No one else wears them. And that revolver, holster
and belt could have been obtained from no other
person on earth except a policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange. I wonder how he came by
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick did not answer immediately. His mind had
turned to very sober thoughts. The more he dwelt
upon this unusual circumstance&mdash;an Indian wearing
mounted police boots and carrying a service revolver&mdash;the
more he became perplexed. As they made
their way back to their own party, his suspicions
grew. A great fear tugged at his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Brady,&rdquo; he began very soberly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
this. I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The physician turned and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Still thinking about those boots? I
wouldn&rsquo;t worry, if I were you, Dick. The explanation
is probably simple enough. The boots and revolver
might have been discarded. Aren&rsquo;t you
troubling yourself needlessly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think not. You remember Corporal Rand,
don&rsquo;t you, the man Inspector Cameron spoke of, the
one he sent up here ahead of us, and about whom
he was so worried?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Dr. Brady. &ldquo;Corporal Rand.
The name is familiar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; trembled Dick, &ldquo;I have a terrible suspicion
that those boots and that revolver belong to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Brady&rsquo;s turn to become grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believe that he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to believe,&rdquo; Dick filled in the
pause. &ldquo;It looks bad. They might have killed him.
They&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, overcome by such a probability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, doctor,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;Corporal Rand
wouldn&rsquo;t carry an extra pair of boots and probably
not an extra revolver along with him. Just remember
that. If the Indian didn&rsquo;t kill him, something
or someone else did. He might have taken those
things off Rand&rsquo;s dead body. Somehow, I feel that I
ought to go back and question him&mdash;make him talk.
I don&rsquo;t like the looks of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were now within a short distance of their
own party, and an idea suddenly occurred to
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll get Toma to go with
me. He speaks the Indian language more fluently.
The two of us will go over there armed and compel
that rascal to confess. And we won&rsquo;t come back
either until&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Dr. Brady interrupted him. Dr. Brady had seized
him by the shoulders and was staring into his face,
his eyes wide with excitement. Then he swung the
younger man in front of him, released him, and with
one trembling hand pointed in the direction of their
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that! Look at that! What? I say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly Dick&rsquo;s body grew taut. The color
drained from his cheeks. He shook off the restraining
hand and started forward. He ran. He shouted
out at the top of his voice, one hand fumbling with
the holster at his side. In his haste to get forward
quickly, he stumbled and fell. As he rose to his feet,
he broke into an exclamation of dismay.</p>
<p>He was too late! The long-looked-for attack had
taken place. The drivers had overpowered Toma
and Sandy, had seized the guns, two of the dog teams
and sledges, loaded with supplies, and were now hurrying
back. They had accomplished their purpose
and had made good their escape. When Dick reached
the scene of disaster a few minutes later, he cried
out in his rage and exasperation.</p>
<p>Thrown across one of the sledges were Toma and
Sandy, bound securely hand and foot. A few yards
away, lying helplessly in the snow, was the unconscious
form of one of the drivers, who, upon closer
examination, proved to be Lamont. Everywhere
was confusion and disorder. Several of the sledges
had been overturned, their loads scattered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Dick took out his hunting knife and cut the rope
which bound his two chums. They were both a little
dazed, but had not been seriously hurt. They looked
at him with sombre eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>Sandy sat up and commenced rubbing his chafed
arms and legs. Tears of exasperation trickled down
his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came so&mdash;so suddenly, Dick,&rdquo; he choked. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t begin to tell you. We were sitting on the mail
sledge, when one of the drivers came along, passing
about twenty feet away. He acted queerly. He commenced
to groan, and then suddenly he fell down in
the snow, just as if he had fainted dead away. It
was a trick&mdash;but we didn&rsquo;t know it. We rushed over
to help him. We were stooping down when they
came up from behind&mdash;the whole crowd of them, and
seized us so quickly we didn&rsquo;t have a chance. I&rsquo;m
so&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fresh tears trickled from his eyes again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Lamont&mdash;what&rsquo;s he doing there? What happened
to him? If you didn&rsquo;t have a chance to do
anything, how did he receive his injury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma&mdash;&mdash; When they grappled with him, he
fired from his hip and got Lamont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Brady, who had come panting up in time to
hear Sandy&rsquo;s story, now turned toward the prostrate
body of the guide, and with the help of Dick and
Toma, carried him over and placed him on one of
the sledges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never make the trip,&rdquo; presently announced
the doctor. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s hit in the shoulder&mdash;a dangerous
wound&mdash;and will never be able to stand the jarring
and jolting of one of the sledges. We&rsquo;ll have to leave
him here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we do that?&rdquo; asked Sandy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d
freeze. He&rsquo;d&mdash;he&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Indian encampment,&rdquo; suggested the
physician. &ldquo;They can look after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good riddance,&rdquo; declared Dick. &ldquo;I, for one,
won&rsquo;t be sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There followed an awkward silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian encampment,&rdquo; said Dick at length,
&ldquo;will be forced not only to look after Lamont but to
supply us with several drivers. Perhaps one of them
will know the way to Keechewan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, gesturing hopelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any event, we&rsquo;ll have to push on. We can&rsquo;t
stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Brady nodded grimly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">BILL AND THOMAS</span></h2>
<p>In front of a crackling wood fire, three men
dried their wet and bedraggled garments. In spite
of the close proximity to the blaze they shivered
and their teeth chattered and they looked very unhappy
and uncomfortable, indeed. Two of the men
wore the conventional garb of white prospector or
trapper, while the third, a tall, rather handsome
fellow with clear blue eyes and a decisive chin,
was arrayed in what might once have been a uniform
of his majesty&rsquo;s Royal North West Mounted
Police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We gotta thank you,&rdquo; said one of the men quite
humbly, &ldquo;fer gettin&rsquo; us out of that river. Yuh saved
our lives all right, but our grub-stake an&rsquo; ever&rsquo;thing
we had is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he resumed mournfully. &ldquo;Gone! It&rsquo;s Bill&rsquo;s
fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the man in the wretched uniform,
&ldquo;that it was partly my fault. I startled him. I
shouldn&rsquo;t have cried out to you. It drew his attention
and for a moment he must have forgotten to
steer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>The maligned and unfortunate person referred to
as &ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; drew himself up to a proud height and
grunted his disdain. Then he turned his back
haughtily upon his partner and addressed himself to
the man in the uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas here,&rdquo; he declared deprecatingly, jerking
one thumb over his shoulder, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t allers responsible
fer what he says. I wasn&rsquo;t the only one that&rsquo;s
been a steerin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that boat. He was a helpin&rsquo; too.
An&rsquo; he kep&rsquo; puttin&rsquo; me off, Thomas did, with his
jabbin&rsquo; here an&rsquo; there in the water, like the crazy
fool what he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; remonstrated Thomas. &ldquo;Did
yuh tell the officer what yuh done yisterday? I &rsquo;spose
that wuz all my fault too&mdash;you runnin&rsquo; aground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill wheeled about so swiftly that his dripping
garments sprayed water in every direction. For a
moment even the fire sputtered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lie!&rdquo; shouted the now infuriated Bill. &ldquo;I wuz
asleep in the boat an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep when yuh wuz supposed to be on duty,&rdquo;
his partner completed the sentence for him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the trouble with you, Bill. You don&rsquo;t pay no &rsquo;tention
to nothin&rsquo;. Yuh don&rsquo;t use your brains; yuh don&rsquo;t
look; yuh don&rsquo;t listen. Yuh go &rsquo;round dreamin&rsquo;, with
your head up in the air an&rsquo; your intelligence in the
seat o&rsquo; your pants. An&rsquo;,&rdquo; Thomas completed his lecture
defiantly, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take that back neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation had reached a critical, dangerous
stage, and the man in the frayed uniform thought it
wise to intervene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll pardon me, gentlemen, I believe I can
settle this dispute. I&rsquo;ve been thinking it over, and
the more I think about it, the more clearly it appears
to me that the responsibility is all mine. It was my
shout that startled both of you, that put you off&mdash;that
caused all the trouble. I&rsquo;d like to apologize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wuz a terrible shout,&rdquo; admitted Thomas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounded like the howl of a madman,&rdquo; declared
Bill. &ldquo;But yuh saved our lives an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo;
I won&rsquo;t forget in a hurry. We&rsquo;d be down in the
bottom of the river now, keepin&rsquo; company with our
rifles an&rsquo; our grub-stake, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the uniform acknowledged the compliment
with a somewhat weary smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I saved you from one disaster only
to plunge you into another. What are you going to
do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jus&rsquo; what do yuh mean?&rdquo; asked Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you manage without rifles and supplies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill shook his head mournfully and turned to his
partner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s askin&rsquo; yuh a question,&rdquo; he upbraided him,
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t yuh hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas immediately applied himself to the problem
in hand. He stared gloomily at the fire. Suddenly
he brightened. He addressed the mounted
policeman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you got grub, ain&rsquo;t yuh? You can sell us a
little&mdash;enough to take us over to Half-Way House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost in as bad straits as you are. I have
a little flour&mdash;five or six pounds. I&rsquo;ve had trouble
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five or six pounds o&rsquo; flour ain&rsquo;t very much fer
three hungry men like us,&rdquo; ruminated Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Thomas bitterly. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s all yuh got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All. Absolutely all! Found it in a cabin back
here in the woods. I&rsquo;m very sorry, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas dismissed the matter with a wave of his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it can&rsquo;t be helped&mdash;it can&rsquo;t. I been plenty
hungry before this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; murmured Bill.</p>
<p>An interval of silence, during which three men
shivered and shook before the fire&mdash;a fire that had
commenced to burn itself out. Red, angry embers
blinked up at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your turn to gather more wood,&rdquo; Bill informed
Thomas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Thomas scowled at the unpleasant imminence of
this chilly duty and spat disgustedly into the lowering
flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh better hurry,&rdquo; implacably his partner
spurred him on. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon be freezin&rsquo; entirely.
There ain&rsquo;t enough heat here to warm a sparrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas grunted out an oath before he departed,
purposely bumping against Bill as he lumbered past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh can see the sort o&rsquo; disposition he&rsquo;s got,&rdquo;
Bill complained to the policeman. &ldquo;I been aputtin&rsquo; up
with this sort o&rsquo; thing fer ten years now&mdash;ten years
this comin&rsquo; March since we become partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that he was shivering, uncomfortable,
worried, suffering untold agonies from his
feet, the man in the frayed uniform smiled quietly to
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you break your partnership?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh&mdash;what? What did yuh say, officer? Break
up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Bill was so amazed, so utterly dumfounded
at this simple solution to his difficulties, that
he could not find words to express himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said. Break up your partnership.
Quit each other. Each go your own way,&rdquo; elucidated
the policeman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>It was an appalling thought. Unthinkable. Bill
tried to picture a bleak pattern of existence from
which Thomas had become erased. It filled him with
a sense of loss so tremendously acute that it positively
hurt. Little shivers of dismay ran up along his spine
and seemed to settle there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Thomas ain&rsquo;t so bad, once yuh get used to
him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thomas got a queer way about him,
an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s cantankerous an&rsquo; stubborn, but he really
don&rsquo;t mean nothin&rsquo;. Besides, I don&rsquo;t rightly know
what Thomas&rsquo;d do after I left. He&rsquo;s sort o&rsquo; helpless
without me. He&rsquo;s got so he sort o&rsquo; depends on me.
Wouldn&rsquo;t be worth his salt. I&rsquo;d hate fer his
sake&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas himself interrupted the conversation at
this point by striding up with a huge armful of wood
and throwing it angrily down upon the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh can toast your shins now,&rdquo; he declared angrily,
glancing at Bill. &ldquo;But next time it&rsquo;s your turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time it&rsquo;s my turn,&rdquo; admitted Bill pleasantly.
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ferget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll likely be asleep by then,&rdquo; sputtered
Thomas. &ldquo;Great guns!&mdash;but ain&rsquo;t that wind cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winter&rsquo;ll soon be here,&rdquo; Bill croaked, humping
up his shoulders and fighting back the smoke that
drifted up around his head and into his eyes. &ldquo;Six
pounds o&rsquo; flour between three men an&rsquo; winter, an&rsquo;
five hundred miles to the nearest tradin&rsquo; post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keechewan Mission is closer than that,&rdquo; Thomas
corrected him. &ldquo;I &rsquo;spose we can go that way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; shivered Bill. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as close to Keechewan
Mission as I intend to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you come from there?&rdquo; sharply inquired the
policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Thomas, &ldquo;but we heard about it.
It&rsquo;s rotten with smallpox an&rsquo; boilin&rsquo; with trouble like
a hot teakettle. It ain&rsquo;t no good place fer a white
man to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going there,&rdquo; said the policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh don&rsquo;t say?&rdquo; gasped both men in one voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can make it on two pounds of flour,&rdquo; appended
the policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said yuh had six,&rdquo; remembered Thomas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll divide with you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill and Thomas exchanged glances of genuine
wonder and admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like tuh shake hands with you,&rdquo; declared
Thomas in an awed voice, offering one dirty paw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; said Bill, extending a hand equally as
dirty. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a real man an&rsquo; no mistake about that.
What&rsquo;s your name, officer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal Rand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackenzie barracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ain&rsquo;t gettin&rsquo; personal, where&rsquo;s your boots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Nitchie stole them one night while I slept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dirty skunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; your revolver?&rdquo; noticed Thomas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stole that too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh mean to tell me,&rdquo; exploded Bill, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo; up to Keechewan like that&mdash;no boots, two
pounds o&rsquo; flour an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; to protect yourself with
when them rampagin&rsquo; Nitchies catch sight o&rsquo; yuh? If
cold an&rsquo; hunger don&rsquo;t get yuh, the smallpox will, an&rsquo;
if the smallpox don&rsquo;t get yuh, the Nitchies will. Yuh
got about as much chance to come back alive as I
have o&rsquo; jumpin&rsquo; up to the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool to try it,&rdquo; grumbled Thomas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my instructions,&rdquo; said Corporal Rand,
and then remembered suddenly that this was not
the truth. &ldquo;I mean to say, I did have my instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; yuh lost &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The inspector changed his mind. He decided
to go himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t yuh let him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was either his life or mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas was puzzled. He appealed to Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make nothin&rsquo; out of this, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill came to the rescue. He picked up the thread
of discourse, where the other had let it fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do yuh mean to say that this here inspector&rsquo;s
life is worth more to you than what your own is?
That don&rsquo;t seem reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to give you four pounds of flour in the
morning,&rdquo; Corporal Rand smiled. &ldquo;Now do you
mean to tell me that your lives are worth more to
me than my own. Just figure it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill and Thomas exchanged worried, doubtful
glances, and commenced to figure. For twenty long
minutes they threaded their way through a deep and
abysmal mental swamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out,&rdquo; acknowledged Thomas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me neither,&rdquo; grumbled Bill. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bloomin&rsquo;
martyr an&rsquo; no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; we can give you,&rdquo; lamented
Thomas, feeling in all of his pockets.</p>
<p>Then suddenly his face brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he announced proudly, presenting it, &ldquo;is
somethin&rsquo; yuh can have. Take it. Yuh never can
tell. Mebbe it&rsquo;ll save your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand received the gift in the spirit that
it was given. Nor did he belittle such a gift. Too
well he knew the vagaries of the North, the unexpected
turns of fortune, good and bad, the little
inconsequential things upon which hinge life or death
itself. Moisture had gathered in his eyes as carefully,
almost lovingly, he put the gift away in an
inner pocket:</p>
<p>Three fishhooks and a ball of string!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">AN INDIAN WITH BOOTS</span></h2>
<p>Dick, Sandy and Toma hurried over to the Indian
encampment in the afternoon of the same day the
dog drivers had deserted them. Toma, it was decided,
would act as interpreter, while Sandy&mdash;as he
expressed it&mdash;merely trailed along to lend his moral
support and to give advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must offer them unheard of wages for the
trip,&rdquo; reasoned Sandy. &ldquo;We must give them presents
and supplies. These Indians don&rsquo;t know the meaning
or value of money, so you&rsquo;d better make them an
offer they can understand. I&rsquo;d start out by offering
each one a brand new rifle and a winter&rsquo;s grub-stake,
also some bright-colored cloth for the squaws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That not bad idea,&rdquo; Toma approved. &ldquo;I tell &rsquo;em
that. I do my best. I say plenty. Make &rsquo;em good
speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can say anything you like,&rdquo; Dick instructed
him, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t promise them anything we can&rsquo;t
give.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>So Toma, in his role of employment agent, made
a round of the tepees. He was received warmly and,
thus encouraged, waxed eloquent. He described to
them the vast number of beautiful and useful things
that could be obtained in the stores at the mission:
Fruits (dried), of delicious flavor, from lands
beyond the seas; meat from animals they had never
tasted (pork); flour in large quantities for the making
of bannock; sugar, both brown and white. Then,
taking a new tack, for the benefit of the women, he
told them about the multi-colored fabrics of wool and
silk and cotton, of ornaments for the fingers and
beads for the neck, of things that pleased and delighted
the eye.</p>
<p>The Indians sat in open-mouthed wonder as Toma
went breathlessly on with his fanciful description
of the gifts that might be theirs if only the young
men would assist them in driving the dog teams to
Keechewan. And in order to convince them of the
sincerity of his intentions, at Dick&rsquo;s request, he
offered each of the families a small quantity of tea,
sugar and bacon, to be delivered at once.</p>
<p>The leader of the Indians at the encampment made
a quick calculation. Besides himself, he told Toma,
there were eight able-bodied hunters. They could
spare a few of these. Perhaps half could go. They
would be very glad to help their white brothers.
They would appreciate the gifts described. Toma and
his friends could be assured of their co-operation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>A surge of happiness ran through Dick as he
listened to the leader&rsquo;s words. Then he bethought
him of Lamont, and his face clouded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma,&rdquo; he directed in English, &ldquo;tell the leader
about Lamont. Ask him if we can leave him here
until we return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the request had been made, the boys waited
expectantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this injured brother?&rdquo; demanded the
chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A worthless dog,&rdquo; replied Toma. &ldquo;He was a
traitor to us. He and his companions fought us,
and during the encounter I was compelled to shoot
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian&rsquo;s face darkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will my brother promise not to shoot any of my
people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma hastened to set his mind at rest. Then he
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will your young men be ready to start?
We are very anxious to proceed on our journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow morning,&rdquo; answered the leader.</p>
<p>In high spirits, the three chums left the Indian
encampment and went back to their own camp. Dr.
Brady greeted them anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we have been successful,&rdquo; Dick informed
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;How many men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The leader said four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will they look after Lamont?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they gave us their promise. I think we&rsquo;d
better take him over there right away and pitch our
tents. Might as well be there as here. Saves running
back and forth, and besides, we promised the
Indians a small quantity of provisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remainder of the day passed quickly. A place
was made for Lamont, and Dr. Brady succeeded in
extracting the bullet and washed and dressed the
wound. The guide had recovered consciousness by
this time and lay staring up at the brown walls of
the tepee with dark malevolent eyes.</p>
<p>When morning came, the boys rose early and went
over to the leader&rsquo;s tepee, pleased when they found
him and his household already awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are your young men ready?&rdquo; asked Toma. &ldquo;We
wish to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some inexplicable reason, during the night
the Indian&rsquo;s manner had cooled. He received them
with little of his former cordiality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are your young men ready?&rdquo; persisted Toma.</p>
<p>The leader fixed them with a sombre stare and, to
the boys&rsquo; surprise and astonishment, shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have asked me to inform you that they
have changed their minds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Changed their minds!&rdquo; Sandy started back in
dismay, while Dick rubbed his eyes, under the impression
that he had not heard aright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have decided not to go,&rdquo; repeated the leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma,&rdquo; said Dick in hoarse undertones, &ldquo;tell
him to summon those young men and we will talk
to them. They must go. They have promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian complied with the request. Soon the
young men appeared before them and stood awkwardly
and shyly beside their leader. But every argument
failed to move them. No, they would not go.
They must look after their trap-lines. They were
very sorry to disappoint their white brothers, but
the thing was impossible.</p>
<p>In desperation, Toma made a brief summary of
his speech of the day before. They were foolish to
spurn his offer. He would even increase his reward.
Instead of one rifle, he would give them two, and
many traps and cartridges.</p>
<p>This time, however, his oratory suffered from
repetition. The young men were very much interested
but not enthusiastic. Only one of the four
stepped forward to announce that he would go.
Further argument proved useless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dick, turning to Dr. Brady, &ldquo;one
man is better than none at all. We&rsquo;ll manage somehow,
I suppose. I wonder if this young man knows
the way to the mission?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Upon being questioned, the Indian declared that
he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will show you the way,&rdquo; he informed Toma.</p>
<p>Disappointed, the boys made their preparations for
the start. Soon they were on the trail, their teams
doubled up&mdash;twelve dogs in one string, pulling two
sleighs; ten in another, while the only single team
were the six malemutes who pulled the mail sledge.
However, they were scarcely out of sight of the
encampment, when, looking back, Sandy saw two
figures on snowshoes, following them at a rapid
rate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he shouted to his companions ahead, immediately
checking his own team.</p>
<p>They waited until the two figures came up to them,
two Indians from the encampment: the leader and,
to the boys&rsquo; surprise, the young Indian, who wore
the service boots and revolver of the mounted police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; demanded Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This young man,&rdquo; replied the leader, pointing
to his companion, &ldquo;wishes to go with you too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, Dick was in a quandary. He required
the fellow&rsquo;s assistance, yet he was afraid to
include him in their party. The Indian might be a
murderer or a thief. His appearance was against
him. He might prove to be a worse customer than
Lamont. The leader noticed Dick&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is a very good man on the trail,&rdquo; he hastened
to assure them. &ldquo;You will not be sorry if you take
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; decided Dick, &ldquo;he can come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all, he reasoned, it would be just as well if
he did. Perhaps they might be able to discover the
mystery of those boots.</p>
<p>Again the party started forward. With the acquisition
of the man in the mounted police boots, they
were now able to send one of their number forward
to break trail. They hurried quickly along, and by
noon had reached a height of land, looking down
from which, they perceived the rugged valley of the
Wapiti River. At sight of it, the boys&rsquo; delight was
unbounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting along splendidly,&rdquo; remarked Sandy.
&ldquo;If only the weather will stay like it is, it won&rsquo;t
be very long now until we reach Keechewan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope weather get cold,&rdquo; said Toma. &ldquo;Weather
been warm now for two, three days. If it get cold,
make &rsquo;em crust on snow. No need to break trail.
Then we be able to go along very fast&mdash;mebbe fifty,
sixty miles in one day. Dogs run all time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>But it was not until three days later, after they
had crossed the Wapiti and were proceeding northward
across a level, wind-swept district, that colder
weather actually arrived. A fierce Arctic blast beat
down upon them, chilling their blood. Particles of
frost hung in the air. Trees cracked, as the intense
cold penetrated within, freezing the sap. Yet, though
the weather was almost unendurable, Toma&rsquo;s prophecy
had come true, and they were able to speed across
the level waste, the miles dropping away behind
them.</p>
<p>One night, following an intensely bitter spell of
cold, they drew up to make camp in the lee of a
tree-covered hill. All night long they took turn in
replenishing the fires. But even with this help, and
wrapped in blankets, fold on fold, they had difficulty
in keeping warm. They were glad when morning
came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; shivered Dick to Sandy, muffling his
face in the collar of his fur coat, &ldquo;that the weather
moderates a little before night. This is terrible. It
must be fifty below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems more like seventy-five below to me,&rdquo;
grumbled Sandy, stirring the fire with a long poplar
stick, his eyes blinking as a flurry of wind caught
the smoke and sent it whirling around him.</p>
<p>At this juncture, Dr. Brady came hurrying up,
gesturing excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve more bad news for you, Dick. Just found
out. Toma and I made the discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was conscious of a sudden sinking feeling
in the pit of his stomach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, doctor?&rdquo; he finally managed to articulate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your team of malemutes is gone, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you must be mistaken,&rdquo; interrupted Dick.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re here somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the mail sledge is gone too, including all
that quantity of vaccine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy threw up his hands in a gesture of hopeless
surrender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the physician more calmly, &ldquo;the
Indian with the mounted police boots is gone too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick gave way to his feeling of despair. He put
his head in his hands and rocked back and forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it! I knew it!&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;I knew all
the time that I ought not trust that&mdash;that miserable
thief. I hesitated when his services were offered to
me. I&rsquo;m a fool. Why did I take him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Sandy broke forth,
&ldquo;&mdash;what I can&rsquo;t understand, Dick, is why he should
take the sledge with the mail. There isn&rsquo;t a single
thing on that sledge that would be of the least value
to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, he didn&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; Brady spoke up.
&ldquo;To his simple ignorant mind, those pouches of mail
must have contained something of immense value.
He&rsquo;ll be a very sorry, disgusted and probably repentant
Indian when he discovers his mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be a repentant Indian when I get my hands
on him,&rdquo; stormed Dick, jumping to his feet and pulling
his parka in place. &ldquo;Well, I might just as well
go after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has about three hours start of you,&rdquo; said
Dr. Brady. &ldquo;The only time he could have left this
party was between four and five o&rsquo;clock, when he was
awakened to take his turn in replenishing the fires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll unload one of the sledges and take the swiftest
team we have,&rdquo; decided Dick. &ldquo;Travelling light, I
ought to be able to overtake him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I go with you, Dick?&rdquo; Sandy asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have you, Sandy, but Toma is better
on the trail. I must hurry. Every minute counts.
Dr. Brady, will you help Sandy pick out and harness
a team, while Toma and I unload a sledge? We&rsquo;ll
take our rifles and a few days&rsquo; provisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In less than twenty minutes, they were ready.
The dogs strained at their harness, eager to start.
Toma took his place in the front of the sledge, Dick
behind. A whip cracked. The voices of Dr. Brady
and Sandy called out an encouraging farewell.</p>
<p>The huskies leaped forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">THE PURSUIT</span></h2>
<p>A cold bitter wind hurled its defiance along the
slope, its shrieking voice trumpeting through the
pines. In the sky&mdash;a vast canopy flung over a frozen
world&mdash;the sun shone wanly. On either side of the
sun hung sun-dogs. In the air&mdash;frost. Below, a
limitless, monotonous expanse of snow.</p>
<p>In the sledge, which flew along over the hard
snow-surface, Dick and Toma sat muffled to their
ears. From time to time, they beat their arms about
their shivering bodies and urged on the dogs. Already
they had come eight or ten miles along the faint
trail they had made on the previous day.</p>
<p>In their pursuit of the Indian they had expected,
quite naturally, to go southwestward in the direction
of the Indian encampment. With their lighter load
and swifter team; they would rapidly gain on him.
Before night, surely, they would overtake him. It
was all simply a matter of time and patience and perseverance.
In the end, they would be successful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Much to their surprise, the thief chose a different
route entirely. Apparently he had no intention of
returning to his home and friends with his ill-gained
booty. A few miles farther on, he had set his course
to the west, following a hill-chain that ran parallel
to the Wapiti River.</p>
<p>The boys turned sharply and continued the pursuit.
The sledge tracks of the thief could be discerned
quite plainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine where he&rsquo;s going,&rdquo; mused Dick.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t to his own home. Where do you suppose,
Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe up in the hills somewhere to another encampment.
Mebbe him &rsquo;fraid to go back to his own
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; guessed the other, &ldquo;perhaps his purpose is
to make a secret cache up there in the hills. He
thinks, no doubt, that the mail sacks and medicine
chests are filled with valuable provisions. I&rsquo;d like
to see his face when he opens one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma broke into a low chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It make me laugh if he try drink medicine an&rsquo;
get very sick. Mebbe him fool enough to think
medicine some new kind of whiskey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help him, if he does. I don&rsquo;t know what sort
of medicine Dr. Brady may have there. There&rsquo;s
vaccine for smallpox and drugs of all kinds. I&rsquo;m
sure that some of them are deadly poison. He&rsquo;s apt
to be more than sick if he tries it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Presently the trail wound into the hills. It went up
and up and up, and then down and then up again.
It skirted deep ravines and dangerous precipices. It
crossed the wide basin of a lake. It continued on&mdash;the
rutted tracks of that thief&rsquo;s sledge&mdash;with the unbroken
insistence of the passing of time itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s certainly travelling and no mistake. He
must be going almost as fast as we are,&rdquo; complained
Dick. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll kill that team of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry, we catch him. Pretty soon we
catch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will, of course, if we don&rsquo;t lose his trail. The
fool will be compelled to stop soon for something to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes Indians go days without stop for
something to eat,&rdquo; commented Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if he thinks he has a store of precious things
aboard,&rdquo; grinned his companion. &ldquo;His fingers will
be itching to get at those sacks. He&rsquo;ll want to explore
the mystery of those medicine chests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Toma chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This mail all same like &rsquo;em paper?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is paper,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;Envelopes, hundreds
of envelopes, bulging with paper. Then, in the second-class
mail pouches, there&rsquo;ll be circulars and
catalogs and newspapers, hundreds of pounds altogether
to tempt his mounting appetite. I think he&rsquo;ll
relish the stamps too. They&rsquo;ll be green and red,
with a picture of King George on one side and mucilage
on the other. The mucilage has a sweet, toothsome
taste he&rsquo;ll like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma doubled up in a paroxysm of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that very good joke on that Indian. Mebbe
him find out it bad thing to steal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. He looks as if he were
beyond redemption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma cracked his whip, and the huskies sprang
forward, scrambling up an incline. It was steep
here, so Dick got out and trotted behind. The exercise
warmed his feet and sent the blood racing
through his body.</p>
<p>When he tumbled back on the sledge again, Toma
half-turned and with the butt of his whip pointed
excitedly at the dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>The sudden change in the behavior of the huskies
was very noticeable. Their ears were pricked higher.
The leader, a beautiful long-haired malemute, so
much resembling a wolf that it was almost impossible
to tell the difference, had commenced to whine softly,
straining at her harness in fitful, nervous leaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody close ahead,&rdquo; Toma whispered. &ldquo;We
see &rsquo;em pretty quick now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Dick leaned forward and picked up his rifle, and
commenced fumbling with the breech. His expression
had grown suddenly tense. He rose to a position on
his knees, swaying there from the motion of the
sleigh, his gaze set unwaveringly, expectantly, on
the trail ahead.</p>
<p>At a furious rate of speed, they descended another
slope, then, more slowly, began circling up around
the next hill, emerging to a sparsely wooded area,
which, in turn, at the farther side, dropped abruptly
to a deep tree-covered valley.</p>
<p>Abruptly, the boys turned toward each other.
Toma muttered something under his breath; Dick
relaxed to a sitting position, whistling his astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect anything like this,&rdquo; remarked
Dick, recovering somewhat from his surprise. &ldquo;An
Indian village! Look, Toma, there are scores of
tepees down there. No wonder he came this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they started&mdash;but not at the sight of those
tepees, strung along the floor of the valley, nor yet at
the sight of the Indians themselves, here and there
plainly distinguishable&mdash;but at the appearance of a
loaded sledge behind a team of gray malemutes, proceeding
quickly toward the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t very far ahead of us,&rdquo; exulted Dick.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll soon be cornered. He can&rsquo;t get away. We&rsquo;ve
won, Toma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma&rsquo;s eyes were shining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him big fool to come here. What you think?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;He may have friends. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll want to
shield him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Indian&rsquo;s answer was to crack his whip
and to shout to the huskies. The sledge leaped forward.
It threw up a quantity of loose snow, through
which it plowed. It rocked perilously as it negotiated
the top of the valley slope, then, in spite of Dick&rsquo;s
foot pressed hard on the brake-board, shot down,
almost running over the dogs.</p>
<p>Taking a steeper but more direct route to the
village than had been attempted by the thief, they
were only a few yards behind him when they made
their final whirlwind spurt through the orderly row
of tepees and the gaping crowds, and came to a
jarring but dramatic halt.</p>
<p>The thief was unaware of his danger, had not even
a premonition of the near presence of his pursuers,
until, with a certain amusing dignity, he slipped from
the top of his precious load and waved an exaggerated
greeting to the crowd.</p>
<p>His triumph was short-lived. Out of the corner
of one eye, he saw two figures who looked strangely
familiar. In order to make sure, he turned his head
and in that moment his self-confidence poured from
him like water out of a bucket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>A tiny squeak, of the sort a mouse makes under
the heel of an enraged householder, and his mittened
hands went straight up. He came forward, bellowing
for mercy. Tears of terror welled into his eyes.
Never before had Dick seen any person more craven,
cowardly-weak and utterly disgusting than he.
Somehow, it blunted the edge of his own and Toma&rsquo;s
victory to take a man like that. It was too easy.</p>
<p>Startled at first, the onlookers broke into a roar
of laughter. They were quick to grasp the situation.
In a trice, the two boys and their prisoner were the
pivot around which circled and revolved a jeering,
highly-amused crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ask &rsquo;em me to make &rsquo;em talk about how it
all happen,&rdquo; Toma shouted in Dick&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them that we&rsquo;ll explain later,&rdquo; Dick instructed.
&ldquo;Say that we want something to eat. Tell
them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off as the milling throng unexpectedly
drew back, making a path for a white-haired old man,
who carried himself with great dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief,&rdquo; said Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the truth, Toma. Nothing else. Explain to
him that this man is a thief, that we followed him
here to recover valuable mail and medicine for the
sick. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll believe you. Be honest and
straightforward, Toma.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Dick found it utterly impossible to keep his place
at his chum&rsquo;s side. A forward surge of the inquisitive
swept him and his prisoner this way and that,
while shoulders bumped shoulders and curious eyes
peered into his. He was glad when the interview
came to an end and the chief motioned for the
crowd to disperse. Toma sought him out, smiling
with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever&rsquo;thing all right, Dick. Chief him know this
man for very bad fellow. He say him very glad if
you leave him to be punish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he belong to this tribe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good notion to do it. It will save us a lot
of trouble and worry. By the way, did you remember
to tell him about the police boots and revolver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I tell him that too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After while I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not now, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand bye-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-bye. You come with me
pretty soon to chief&rsquo;s tepee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Well, they can have this cowardly
sneak if they want him. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>A little later, escorted by one of the headmen of
the village, Dick and Toma arrived at the tepee of the
chief. On hands and knees, they crawled through
the aperture, over which hung a wide strip of tanned
moose-hide, soft as chamois. Bear-skins covered
the earth floor within, except in the center space,
where a wood fire burned cheerfully. It was warm
inside the tepee and clean and tidy. A faint odor of
wood smoke mingled with the more pungent and
appetizing smell of broiling meat.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s first impression was that it was pleasant to
be there in so warm and comfortable a place; his
next, a condition accentuated, no doubt, by the boiling
kettle, was a feeling of hunger and weariness.
Presently curiosity induced him to examine the interior
more closely. Looking about, he perceived
several persons of both sexes. One was the white-haired
chief, who had interviewed Toma. Behind
the chief, at a respectful distance, an aged squaw&mdash;probably
the chief&rsquo;s wife, and beyond her an individual
of such unusual appearance that Dick&rsquo;s eyes,
resting upon him, remained there as if transfixed.</p>
<p>The man was emaciated, worn almost to a skeleton.
From the depths of sunken sockets, burned two
feverish eyes. A heavy beard-growth covered, but
did not conceal, the deep hollows under the protruding
cheek bones.</p>
<p>Dick continued to look at the man for several
minutes, conscious of a steadily increasing horror.
The person&rsquo;s forehead was ghastly white, curving up
to a matted crop of straw-colored hair. Around the
drooping shoulders a blanket was held in place with
considerable difficulty by a thin, wasted hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Dick was about to turn his gaze toward something
less pathetic and terrible, when the effort of holding
the blanket in place, proved too much for the unfortunate
creature, and it slipped down over one thin
shoulder, revealing&mdash;to Dick&rsquo;s unutterable amazement&mdash;a
crimson, tattered garment, the tunic of the
royal mounted police.</p>
<p>Reaching out, Dick seized Toma&rsquo;s arm, holding it
in a vice-like grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God help him! Is that Rand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Toma, his voice seeming to come
from a great distance, &ldquo;it Corporal Rand. All time,
before I come here, I knew that. The chief him tell
me all about it. Indian hunter find &rsquo;em Corporal
Rand two days ago, where he lay down in the snow.
Half dead, feet froze, no eat, no rifle&mdash;nothing. He
get much better after while. Bye-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-bye mebbe all
right. Get his sense back. Jus&rsquo; like crazy man now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick gulped down a lump in his throat, and hurried
to the side of the mounted policeman. Gently,
he placed one hand on the corporal&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal Rand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal Rand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know me, corporal. This is Dick Kent.
Toma is here, too. Look up at me, corporal. Look
up! We&rsquo;re here to help you. Look up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Corporal Rand looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Dick Kent,&rdquo; beseeched that young man.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand&mdash;Dick Kent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; muttered the mounted policeman,
and his eyes burned into Dick&rsquo;s, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember that&mdash;certainly.
Tomorrow, gentlemen, we&rsquo;ll divide the
flour. Two to Bill, two to Thomas, two to me.
That&rsquo;s all there is. You&rsquo;re welcome, I&rsquo;m sure. It
was my fault entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand paused, mumbling to himself, wholly unaware
that a tear had fallen from somewhere above
to the thatch of straw-colored hair. His chin dropped
forward until it rested on his chest. His eyes closed
wearily. For a moment he seemed to doze. But
only for a moment&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provoking, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he made a pathetic attempt
at a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d begun to fear I&rsquo;d lost them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost what?&rdquo; gulped Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boots,&rdquo; came the prompt rejoinder, &ldquo;a pair of
boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! But what else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was disappointing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three fishhooks and a ball of string. I&rsquo;m very
sorry, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">THE RETURN TO CAMP</span></h2>
<p>Two courses of action were open to Dick, yet
which one to follow, he did not know. They had
found Corporal Rand, but just what were they going
to do with him? It was a difficult problem to solve,
Dick thought. The corporal was in serious plight and
required medical attention. It was a fortunate thing
that they had found him. It was a fortunate thing,
too, that Dr. Brady was in the vicinity and would
be able to attend him. But the problem&mdash;and it was
not easy to decide&mdash;was whether to bring Dr. Brady
here to the village, or to take Corporal Rand over
to the physician, when he and Toma returned that
afternoon.</p>
<p>He decided finally in favor of the latter course.
They would take Rand with them. Surely if he were
wrapped warmly in blankets and placed in the empty
sleigh, he could endure the cold, would be safe and
comfortable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Then suddenly he remembered that he needed that
sleigh upon his return. That morning he had unloaded
it for the purpose of pursuing the Indian
thief. Either he must secure another one here at the
village, together with a team of huskies, or abandon
his plan.</p>
<p>To his great joy and happiness, therefore, upon
making inquiry, he and Toma were informed that
not only would the chief gladly sell them a team
and sleigh, but also would lend them three of his
best drivers, men who could absolutely be depended
upon to help them on their journey to Keechewan.
More than that&mdash;an act of generosity, which struck
both boys almost dumb with gratitude&mdash;he would
present them with caribou meat and a goodly supply
of frozen fish for the dogs.</p>
<p>In the end, Dick purchased two dog teams and
sledges in place of one. They left the village just as
the sun slipped down below the rim of the valley and
abrupt Arctic night drew on. Across the lonely face
of the hills, they speeded on their way. The Northern
Lights hissed and cracked above their heads.
About them beat the trembling pulse of a vast and
impenetrable silence.</p>
<p>It was after midnight when they reached their
destination, shouting and happy, storming down
upon the row of chilly white tents. Their furious
halloos soon brought Sandy and Dr. Brady shivering
outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Dick?&rdquo; called out Sandy&rsquo;s anxious
voice. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s with you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; came the jubilant answer. &ldquo;Stir up the
fires, Sandy, we&rsquo;re almost famished. No!&mdash;Come
over here, you and Dr. Brady. I have a surprise for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and the physician looked down at the sleeping
form, then across at Dick and Toma in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian with the boots. You&rsquo;ve half-killed
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong. Guess again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of our former dog drivers&mdash;probably Fontaine,&rdquo;
said Dr. Brady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You&rsquo;re not right either. I&rsquo;ll give you one
more chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Sandy growled impatiently. &ldquo;Enough
of this. You&rsquo;re not a child any more. Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who owns the boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian owns the boots,&rdquo; exclaimed Sandy
triumphantly. &ldquo;I guessed right after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t. The Indian don&rsquo;t own the boots.
He stole them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! I know now,&rdquo; sudden light dawned upon
the young Scotchman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a mounted policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Corporal Rand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Breathlessly, Sandy leaned forward over the
sledge. A parka concealed the sleeper&rsquo;s face. Blankets,
many thick folds, enwrapped him. None of the
features was visible. Yet Sandy had seen enough
to convince him that this man was not Rand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should try to deceive me,
Dick,&rdquo; remonstrated Sandy. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the corporal
at all. Too thin. Don&rsquo;t attempt to fool me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the corporal,&rdquo; insisted Dick. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s
changed a lot. I met him face to face, and at first
didn&rsquo;t even recognize him. He must have had a terrible
time. He was picked up two days ago by an
Indian hunter, where he&rsquo;d fallen in the snow. His
feet were badly frozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not much. You see, Sandy, he didn&rsquo;t know
me. He&rsquo;s out of his head. I brought him over here
so that Dr. Brady can help him. We&rsquo;ll have to take
him along with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better not disturb him tonight,&rdquo; Dr. Brady
cut in. &ldquo;I wonder if it will be possible, when you
unhitch that team of dogs, to push this sledge inside
one of the tents. He might wake up if you attempt
to lift him up. In the morning, I&rsquo;ll make my examination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea,&rdquo; said Dick, moving forward to unharness
the team.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Sandy followed him excitedly and touched his
shoulder as he stooped forward. He pointed one arm
in the direction of the other sleighs and dog teams,
where the forms of men were seen hurrying here
and there through the half-light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Two extra
teams and more men! I see you&rsquo;ve recovered the
mail sledge. Who are those fellows, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those,&rdquo; answered Dick, happily, &ldquo;are our new
drivers. And the teams and sledges I purchased over
at the Indian village, where we captured the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Indian village do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up in the hills to the westward, that chain
of hills you saw on this side of the Wapiti. They
run parallel with the river. We followed the tracks
of the thief all the way there, and overtook him just
as he pulled up at the village. He&rsquo;s a renegade member
of that tribe and the chief will punish him. He&rsquo;s
the same man who stole Corporal Rand&rsquo;s boots and
revolver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy straightened up, glaring about him angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad we didn&rsquo;t find that out before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing for that Indian that we didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d have shot him,&rdquo; Sandy bristled, &ldquo;although
shooting&rsquo;s too good for him. He ought to be
flayed alive, tortured, the way they used to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fires were quickly re-kindled, and a lunch prepared.
It was nearly two o&rsquo;clock before everyone
finally retired and the camp became hushed in sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>On the following morning the sun had already
risen, when Toma, the first to awake, crawled wearily
from his blankets into the bitter air of forty below
and proceeded to arouse his comrades. Immediately
there began again the monotonous routine of building
fires and preparing breakfast, assembling the
dogs, and making ready for the day&rsquo;s journey. But
on this occasion, there was in evidence much more
spirit and enthusiasm than at any time during the
preceding two weeks. Dick was reminded of the day
they had left the Mackenzie. Now and again one
might hear the cheery whistle or laugh of one of the
drivers. During breakfast, conversation flourished,
and, after the meal, there took place a keen rivalry
as to who would be the first to harness his team and
take his place at the head of the column.</p>
<p>By mutual arrangement, it fell to the lot of Sandy
to drive the team which conveyed Corporal Rand.
Dr. Brady had completed his examination earlier in
the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pitiable case,&rdquo; he told the boys. &ldquo;Rand&rsquo;s
condition was caused by hardships, privations, hunger
and exposure. He has a wonderful constitution,
or he would never have been able to endure the half
of it. I don&rsquo;t wonder that his mind has become unhinged.
Yet, I haven&rsquo;t the least doubt but he&rsquo;ll recover
his memory and his reasoning powers as his
health improves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you really think he&rsquo;ll get better?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I don&rsquo;t believe there is any question about
that. But he&rsquo;ll never be able to take his place again
in the ranks of the mounted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deep silence followed this statement. Both
Dick&rsquo;s and Sandy&rsquo;s face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? You really mean that, doctor? Will
have to give up his duties&mdash;&mdash; Won&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick left the sentence incompleted as he turned
beseechingly to the physician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;ll never be able to resume his duties,&rdquo;
Brady answered gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; argued Sandy. &ldquo;You just said that
he&rsquo;d recover, would get well again. You said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never said that he&rsquo;d ever walk again,&rdquo; the
doctor reminded him. &ldquo;His feet&mdash;terrible! Frozen,
bruised and cut. I may possibly have to amputate
them. Even if I don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll never be right again.
But,&rdquo; and the doctor looked from one grave face to
the other, &ldquo;we can be mighty thankful that his life
has been spared, that with proper care and attention,
he&rsquo;ll soon recover his full mental and physical
powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick turned his head to hide the tears that had
come unbidden to his eyes. Sandy kicked disconsolately
into a drift of snow, his gaze searching the
ground. Both boys left immediately to take their
places within the line of waiting teams and sledges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;I still insist that we ought to go back and string
up that Indian who stole Corporal Rand&rsquo;s boots,&rdquo;
Sandy declared savagely as he and Dick parted, the
former to go to the invalid&rsquo;s side, the latter to the
mail sledge. &ldquo;The way I feel now, I could gladly
tear that sneaking thief limb from limb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mush! Mush!&rdquo; The words floated down along
the waiting line. &ldquo;Mush, boys, mush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A creaking of sledges, the cracking of whips, a
shout here and there&mdash;and they were away, an orderly
column which, after the first forty or fifty
yards, gathered momentum until it had gained its
maximum of speed, then settled down to a steady,
unchanging pace.</p>
<p>Whatever enjoyment the others might have had at
the commencement of that exhilarating ride, it was
not shared by Dick. For him the day, which had
begun so propitiously, was entirely spoiled. Dr.
Brady&rsquo;s assertion had wrung his heart. Time and
time again, he turned his head and glanced back at
Sandy&rsquo;s sledge to the helpless form lying there, and
sighed bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may never walk again,&rdquo; the sentence haunted
him. &ldquo;A pitiable case! He&rsquo;ll never be able to take
his place again in the ranks of the mounted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>He wondered what Cameron would say when the
news had been brought to him. And Sergeant Richardson&mdash;what
would he say? Rand! One of the
noblest, bravest spirits that had ever come into that
land of noble and brave spirits. No longer a policeman?
That seemed incomprehensible. Rand in
civilian clothes? Dick snorted at the mere suggestion.
To think of the service at all, was to think of
Rand. Rand might have his feet frozen, yea, and
his arms too, and his body hopelessly crushed; yet,
notwithstanding this, in spirit, in reality, in fact, he
would still be a policeman, and nothing else. A
mounted policeman. A scarlet-coated, high-booted,
undaunted and courageous soul.</p>
<p>He was still brooding over this when they pulled
up at the noon hour, hilarious and joyful. They had
made a record run that morning, in spite of the late
start. Drivers shouted at each other as they stepped
from the back of their sledges and dropped their
whips. Dick moved automatically, and he, too,
dropped his whip. But he did not shout. He did not
even smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made good time, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; The voice was
that of Dr. Brady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope this keeps up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, boy,&rdquo; exclaimed Brady in alarm,
&ldquo;you look&mdash;why you look positively ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a good sleep for you tonight. I&rsquo;ll prescribe
it. You&rsquo;ve been worrying too much lately. It isn&rsquo;t
good for you. Yet here I&rsquo;ve come, blundering ass
that I am, to sprinkle a few more gray hairs in your
young head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thrive on responsibility,&rdquo; Dick smiled a little,
&ldquo;so you&rsquo;d better trot it out. What&rsquo;s wrong? Did you
lose your medicine case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Brady laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I almost wish that I could lose it.
No, this worry isn&rsquo;t related to so trivial a thing as a
mere medicine case. It&rsquo;s more important than that.
I&rsquo;m not fooling now, Dick. I&rsquo;m in earnest. I&rsquo;ve
been thinking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the more you think, the worse you feel,&rdquo; interrupted
Dick, a little bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, that&rsquo;s not very kind of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way,&rdquo; Dick flushed. &ldquo;I was
referring to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash; Oh, hang it all, doctor, I&rsquo;m all
upset about Rand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">THE END OF THE JOURNEY</span></h2>
<p>Dr. Brady regarded Dick for a moment thoughtfully.
There was, Dick observed, a certain hesitation
about his manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we left Fort Mackenzie,&rdquo; the physician
began, &ldquo;your Inspector Cameron called me to his
office. He told me about the epidemic. I remember
that there was a large map that hung on the wall
behind his desk, and to this map he frequently referred.
The districts affected by smallpox he had
encircled in red ink. All of these were north of the
Mackenzie: one straight north, several northwest,
but the largest area of all northeast, in a district
which he called Keechewan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brady paused to help Dick unharness one of his
dogs, then continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The circle on the map which he called Keechewan
was, he explained to me, the country most dangerously
affected by smallpox and contained the greatest
number of people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is to be your territory,&rsquo; he told me. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
giving you a most difficult task indeed. Not only
will you experience difficulty in reaching your destination,
but when you do reach it, you may have
trouble with the natives there. There has been an
uprising among several of the Indian tribes. Relations
between the white people and the Indians are
strained. There has been some bloodshed. Your work
will not be easy. It is sure to be dangerous, and possibly,
doctor, you may never come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him if anything had been done to relieve
the situation. He said that he had sent one of his
men, a Corporal Rand, up to that region a few days
before to take charge. He was to place the district
under police rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Brady cleared his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s about all, Dick, but you can see
what I&rsquo;m driving at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dick answered, &ldquo;I think I know what
you&rsquo;re trying to tell me. Corporal Rand never reached
his destination. Misfortune overtook him with the
result that the uprising at Keechewan has never
been put down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. The district, when we reach it, will not
be under police surveillance. We can expect trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>During the trip from Mackenzie River barracks,
Dick had learned to admire and respect the genial
man whom he was conducting to Keechewan. Never
had he occasion to doubt the doctor&rsquo;s courage. In
every emergency, he had not been found wanting.
Yet in the present instance he seemed much worried.
Was he really afraid? Dick decided to try him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may be risking our lives by going to Keechewan
now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you realize that, Dr.
Brady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I realize it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sometimes wonder,&rdquo; Dick evaded the other&rsquo;s
eyes. &ldquo;&mdash;I sometimes wonder if it is all worth while.
Most of them are only Indians. They not only do
not appreciate what we&rsquo;re doing for them, but more
than that, they resent and scorn our help. Why not,&rdquo;
Dick&rsquo;s gaze was fixed on some object on the distant
horizon, &ldquo;leave them to their own devices, let them
suffer the consequences?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Dick had struck Brady in the face, the good
doctor could not have been more surprised. For a
moment he actually sputtered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard Kent! Do you mean that? Do you
really mean to say that you contemplate such a thing&mdash;would
leave those poor devils in the lurch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick raised one hand and grinned mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, doctor! Such a thought hadn&rsquo;t entered
my mind, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rascal! So you were trying me out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick laughed as he turned the dogs loose And
straightened up to take Brady&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you propose to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the question I want to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing that I can see: Do our
work and Corporal Rand&rsquo;s too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I was thinking, why I came to
you just now. I wondered if you had considered the
situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, I hadn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve had so many
other things to worry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be far from Keechewan mission now,&rdquo;
stated the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few more days. Those hills you see over
there in the distance must be the divide Inspector
Cameron spoke of. From there it is not very far
to Keechewan, provided, of course, that we don&rsquo;t
get lost again, that our Indians know the way. We&rsquo;ll
soon enter the barren lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the time being, the subject was dropped. But
Dick did not forget that interview. Often, during
the next three or four days, he found himself contemplating
the future with worried, thoughtful gaze.
He took inventory of his munitions and his provisions.
Not counting Corporal Rand, there were eight
men in the party, really not a very strong force, yet
he comforted himself with the thought that Corporal
Rand had gone forth alone to cope with the situation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>One evening, after they had crossed the divide and
had pitched their tents on a hill, dark with the
shadows of approaching night, a driver drew attention
to an unusual phenomenon. Far away, faint,
yet plainly discernible, was the glimmering of many
tiny lights. These lights blinked and beckoned to
them&mdash;and a cry of elation went up from every
member of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mission!&rdquo; boomed Sandy, throwing his parka
high in the air. &ldquo;Keechewan Mission!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than eight miles away,&rdquo; adjudged
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; said Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll arrive there tomorrow forenoon sometime,&rdquo;
exulted the doctor.</p>
<p>That night, so elated were they, that they could
hardly sleep. Dick and Sandy lay awake until a
late hour, talking and planning. On the following
morning, they rose early to waken the camp. Breakfast
was hurried through, and they were on the trail
nearly an hour before sunrise.</p>
<p>It was eleven o&rsquo;clock by Dick&rsquo;s watch, when they
entered the mission village, their eyes feasting on
the row of snow-roofed cabins that fronted the winding,
narrow street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Here and there, a face appeared at a window.
Now and again, some incurious form opened a door
and watched them go by. But no one was abroad on
the single narrow street. Had it not been for the
sight of smoke, circling upward from mud chimneys,
one might have thought that the village was practically
deserted. There hovered about it an atmosphere
of loneliness. There was something ominous
about it, too, something eerie and unnatural. Dick
felt somehow as if he were proceeding through a village
of the dead. This feeling was accentuated by
the sight of many red flags, draped over windows,
hanging from doors&mdash;mute tokens of a terrible visitation.</p>
<p>It was a mournful little party that drew up in
front of the small but picturesque Catholic Church
at the far end of the winding street. They stood
there as if in doubt and perplexity, looking at each
other, no one volunteering to be the first to move or
make a suggestion. Finally, Dick called to Dr. Brady
and the two strode across to a more or less pretentious
two-storey dwelling, immediately beyond the
church.</p>
<p>A little man, dressed in the flowing robes of a
monk, answered Dick&rsquo;s timorous knock. The priest
started in surprise as he perceived who his visitors
were, then his face brightened and, with a friendly
gesture, he motioned them within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, a slight but unmistakable catch in
his voice. &ldquo;White men! How do you do. You
honor me, monsieurs. May I not bid you welcome?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Inspector Cameron of the mounted police sent
us here to help you,&rdquo; explained Dick. &ldquo;This gentleman
here,&rdquo; indicating Dr. Brady, &ldquo;is an Edmonton
physician. I am Dick Kent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest nodded understandingly and led the
way to a small but nicely furnished room, standing
aside as his visitors entered. At one end of the
room, a spruce log burned brightly in the mud fireplace.
There were several comfortable chairs and
a large bookcase, filled with row upon row of books.
Near the bookcase was a desk, fitted with drawers,
and on its smooth, highly-polished surface were
papers, ink, and a small bronze statue of the Christ.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the room was cheerful and
inviting, and Dick and Dr. Brady immediately felt
at ease. They took the chairs their host indicated,
waiting for him to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent a message to Inspector Cameron,&rdquo; the
priest began fluently, &ldquo;about six weeks ago. I am
glad to see that he is sending help to my stricken
people. You, doctor, are especially welcome. We
have done all that we possibly can to check the course
of the terrible disease, but our efforts, I am sorry to
inform you, have not been very successful. Many,
many deaths have taken place. The villagers are
almost without hope. There are many bereaved,
monsieurs, much suffering and,&rdquo; he hesitated for a
brief moment, &ldquo;much complaining.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;Inspector Cameron,&rdquo; said Dr. Brady, &ldquo;told us
about an uprising of some sort. Has the mission
been attacked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has,&rdquo; the priest nodded. &ldquo;Twice there has
been a general attack, which we repulsed. Since then
we have not been left in peace. Skulkers come here
at night and attempt to fire our dwellings. One man,
a loyal and true friend of mine, was shot down in
the street. We live in apprehension. Daily, there is
some new outrage to add to the complexity of our
other troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick looked across at the grave but patient face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will do all in our power to help you,&rdquo; he encouraged
him. &ldquo;We will attempt to deal with these
skulkers and prevent an uprising. Does most of
your trouble come from outside the village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the most part, yes. There are several Indian
tribes in the vicinity. At first we went among them,
caring for their sick, but lately we have not been able
to do this because of their warlike attitude. On the
last occasion one of us went there, Father Levereaux
was treated most shamefully, subjected to many indignities,
and finally left outside their village. He
was hurt and unconscious when we found him. He
has now, I am glad to inform you, recovered from
his injuries, but I fear that he has contracted smallpox.
Last night, when I went to his room, he was
very ill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will attend him,&rdquo; said Dr. Brady, while Dick
rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are nine men in our party,&rdquo; Dick said.
&ldquo;Perhaps there is an empty dwelling somewhere
where we can stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are several places,&rdquo; the priest answered,
&ldquo;any one of which I can place at your disposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He, too, arose. &ldquo;I will lead you there. You must
rest after your journey. I can see that you are very
tired. I must find you something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; objected Dr. Brady, &ldquo;we must start to work
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you propose to do first?&rdquo; asked the
priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vaccinate every person in the village. After that
I&rsquo;ll attend to those who already have the disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you plenty of medicines and supplies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other&rsquo;s face wreathed in a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is wonderful, monsieur. It was very kind
of you to come. In my heart I thank the noble Inspector
of Police. Praise God, I think we have come
to the end of our trouble. I am very happy, monsieurs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And tears of gladness slowly trickled down his
cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">THE NIGHT PATROL</span></h2>
<p>Dick and his party were billeted a few doors beyond
the mission school in two houses, built of logs&mdash;warm
and comfortable quarters. They found
plenty to occupy their attention for the remainder of
the day. They assisted Dr. Brady, gathered wood,
delivered the mail, and in many other ways made
themselves helpful and useful.</p>
<p>The trouble which the priest, Father Bleriot had
spoken of&mdash;the impending danger of attack, the fear
from the Indians in the hostile villages, not far from
the mission&mdash;did not seem very imminent to them
just then. But as night drew on and the villagers
locked and bolted their doors and native sentinels
commenced to patrol the streets, rifles in hand, the
thing began to take on a different aspect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Nearly every night, so they were informed, some
depredation had been committed. A home was
broken into and looted, a cabin fired, or a bullet
sent crashing through one of the many darkened
windows. Every morning the sentries, who seemed
powerless to prevent it, reported the night&rsquo;s happenings
to one of the three priests, then went away with
sorrowful, wagging heads, only to repeat the same
performance twenty-four hours later.</p>
<p>Hearing of these things, the three boys and one of
the Indian drivers decided to stay up that night to
keep the sentinels company. Dick and the driver
took up a position at the south end of the village,
while Sandy and Toma patrolled the northern section,
in the vicinity of the billet.</p>
<p>The first part of the night, from eight o&rsquo;clock
until midnight, passed without incident. Shortly before
one, Dick and an Indian sentry entered the latter&rsquo;s
home for a cup of tea and a bite to eat before
resuming their lonely vigil. Scarcely had they seated
themselves around the rough board table, when the
crash of a rifle brought them to their feet. They
stormed outside, looking away in the direction from
which the sound had come.</p>
<p>The bright moonlight revealed nothing at first,
but presently, less than a block away, they perceived
an angry red glare and a black funnel of smoke
ascending from one of the cabins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>Outside in the snow were the shivering forms of
women and children, while here and there, householders
rushed frantically about attempting to put
out the blaze. The incendiaries had escaped. It
galled Dick to realize that they had crept up right
under his nose unobserved. The shot they had heard,
he soon learned, had not been fired by the invaders
at all, but by one of the occupants of the burning
cabin in an effort to bring help.</p>
<p>The cabin was doomed. Efforts to save it proved
futile. The native sentry took the women and children
in tow and conducted them along the street to
the shelter of other cabins. Slowly, resentfully, the,
crowd dispersed. The sentry returned, accompanied
by Sandy and Toma and the dog driver. Together
they repaired to the sentry&rsquo;s home, where in gloomy
silence they drank their delayed cup of tea and ate
the hot biscuit their host set before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows&rsquo;d better go back now,&rdquo; said Dick
finally, rising to his feet. &ldquo;Nothing else may happen
tonight, but it&rsquo;s wise to be on our guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grinned as he pushed his empty cup back
from the edge of the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to rub it in, Dick,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;but that was a good joke on you. The cabin that
is burning down isn&rsquo;t more than a block from here.
Whoever set fire to it must have slipped right past
you. What were you doing, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick flushed, but did not reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see anyone?&rdquo; persisted Sandy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. They caught us napping all right. But
be mighty sure, Sandy, that they don&rsquo;t come in on
your side before the night&rsquo;s over. Well, good luck
to you. I&rsquo;ll be along before daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Toma departed, and again Dick and
his two companions took up their lonely patrol. This
time, however, at Dick&rsquo;s suggestion, they separated,
each having under his surveillance a certain definite
section of the village. Up and down, forth and back,
through that cold and stilly night, their moccasined
feet beat across the snow.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, for the second time that night, a
shot rang out. There came the sound of crashing
glass and a woman&rsquo;s startled scream.</p>
<p>It had all happened right in Dick&rsquo;s beat, scarcely
fifty yards away. Instantly he was alert and ready.
This time instead of rushing away toward the cabin
which had been fired on he cut obliquely across the
street in the direction the invader would have taken
in making his get-away. He fairly flew across the
snow, dodged between two low buildings and came
out on the farther side, panting for breath.</p>
<p>In the path of moonlight in the cleared space ahead,
he saw a fleeting form, and, without even pausing
for breath, started forward in swift pursuit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Dick was a fast runner, as he had proved to his
satisfaction many times before. In the present instance,
he put all his heart and strength in the race.
He exerted every ounce of energy. But if he was
fleet of foot, excelling in this particular line of physical
endeavor, so was his opponent. Try as he
would, Dick seemed unable to gain upon him. Between
buildings, across fields, over a narrow footbridge
that crossed a brook, then along a trail that
threaded its way south from the village, the two
forms flew.</p>
<p>After a time Dick began to gain slowly upon his
quarry. Foot at a time, he drew closer. He saw
the Indian, tall and lithe like himself, cast one worried
glance over his shoulder, see that he was being
overtaken, then hurl his rifle to the snow, free
from which encumbrance, he quickly regained his
former advantage.</p>
<p>Somewhat reluctantly, Dick followed suit. He
still carried his revolver at his belt. He puffed as
he ran. The blood throbbed in his ears. The continued
exertion had begun to tell. On and on he
raced, slowly shortening the distance that separated
them. Thirty yards! Twenty yards! He was only
a rod or two behind him now, gaining at every leap.
But with every leap his heart felt as if it would burst
within his body. Finally, in despair, he had commenced
to slacken his pace, when he saw the runner
ahead stumble over some obstruction in the path
and fall heavily.</p>
<p>When the Indian rose choking to his knees, Dick
stood over him, revolver in hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you, you human greyhound,&rdquo; he panted.
&ldquo;You can come back with me now. The race is
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian, of course, did not understand a word
of English. He rose, brushing the snow from his
garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back with me, brother of the deer,&rdquo; ordered
Dick in Cree. &ldquo;Come over on the path here and
start back toward the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His captive obeyed. They marched back, puffing
like two locomotives, one a little shamefacedly, the
other exultantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You run very fast,&rdquo; said Dick admiringly, as he
drove the other on, feeling very magnanimous in his
victory.</p>
<p>The other grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have feet more swift than a wolf,&rdquo; Dick went
on. &ldquo;It was unfortunate for you that you fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the Indian grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you come bothering these people?&rdquo;
Dick took a new tack. &ldquo;They have done nothing to
hurt you. They are your friends. Why do you
attack them and set fire to their homes and send
bullets crashing through their windows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the third time the Indian grunted. Dick gave
up. He could learn nothing from this sullen fellow.
Very well then, he could go back and cool his heels
behind the guarded door of some village dwelling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>They reached the place where Dick had thrown
down his gun, and, farther on, he also picked up
the weapon belonging to his prisoner. Not long
afterward they made their appearance in the village,
where they were met by a number of people, including
Sandy and Toma.</p>
<p>Ordinarily Sandy would have come forward to
compliment Dick upon his achievement, but this
time, for some reason, he refrained. And Sandy&rsquo;s
appearance and behavior were strange. He stood
and stared at Dick almost dully. Toma&rsquo;s attitude was
equally peculiar and inexplicable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought him back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy,&rdquo; stated Dick, &ldquo;this is the Indian who
fired that shot a while ago. I ran him down. What
do you think we&rsquo;d better do with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Sandy muttered, in a voice that
might have come from the depths of some subterranean
vault. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Dick. This is terrible.
What will we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick flushed angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; he snapped out testily, &ldquo;why we&rsquo;ll do what
we&rsquo;ve been doing for the last two months&mdash;the best
we can. What makes Toma stand there like a lump
on a log, eyeing me so queerly? What have I done?
Why, you all act as if I had committed a crime, instead
of bringing this man back to answer for his
misdeeds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>Sandy emerged from his despondency at this unexpected
verbal attack, the light of battle in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; he demanded sharply.
&ldquo;What have you done? Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. You&rsquo;ve
done just what the rest of us have done. Made a
fool out of yourself. Permitted yourself to become
a dupe&mdash;a-sucker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sucker! See here. I&rsquo;ve had about enough of
this. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sandy went inexorably on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Bleriot and Dr. Brady have been captured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Sandy!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; gasped Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been captured, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here, Sandy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, will you, and let me finish. Do you
know why this Indian fired that shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To draw all the guards to this end of the village
so that another attacking party could swoop down
from the other side and play general havoc They
got Brady and Father Bleriot and two of the Indian
servants. No one was there to stop them. They
had plenty of time to get away. Toma and I and the
other guards came down here, while you were chasing
away across country after your friend. Now,
I ask you, what are we to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Dejectedly, Dick put one of his rifles on the
ground and sat down upon it. He was breathing
hard, but not from the effects of the race. His
triumph had been short-lived. He leaned forward
and put his head in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The villagers are panic stricken,&rdquo; Sandy informed
him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re about done for. They&rsquo;ve
lost all hope, and I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re to be blamed
very much either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick raised his eyes. A crowd had gathered round
him. It was a silent crowd. Dejection showed in
every face. Somewhere, at the edge of the gathering
a woman was crying softly. Dick staggered
to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her husband was one of the servants the Indians
took,&rdquo; Sandy explained. &ldquo;Everyone here believes
that we&rsquo;ve seen the last of those four men.
They&rsquo;ll all be murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick found his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does anyone know which way that attacking
party left?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are plenty who can testify to that. They
went north into the barrens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there an Indian village up that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, about four miles from here. What do you
suggest doing, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can do one thing only,&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s tone was
tragic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call for a party of volunteers and set
out in pursuit.&rdquo; He raised his voice: &ldquo;Come now,
who will be the first to go with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Sandy was scarcely a foot behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s hesitation, then the tall form of a
villager drew away from the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will accompany my white brothers,&rdquo; he asserted.</p>
<p>Others also came forward. By ones and twos
they shambled up&mdash;tragic-eyed men, frail, hollow-cheeked
youths, white-haired veterans of a hundred
trap-lines. Steadily they came and took their places
at Dick&rsquo;s side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">DISASTER LOOMS</span></h2>
<p>Four miles is not far. In the north country,
where distance plays such an important part in the
lives of the inhabitants, four miles would be accounted
but a step, a unit of space hardly worth
considering. Yet to Dick and his party, who had
set out in pursuit of the Indian invaders, it seemed a
long way indeed. It was a weary trail and a hard
one. It was fraught with danger, with grave foreboding.</p>
<p>It seemed to the young leader, as they fared forth
across that ghastly moonlit field, that his life had
been spent on trails. Daily he walked along some
trail. At night he slept beside one. When chill
morning broke across a bleak snow-covered land, it
was only to resume that never-ending, continuous
trek.</p>
<p>It was a sort of Nemesis that haunted him. Somehow
he couldn&rsquo;t get away from it. The trail!&mdash;&mdash;It
was there always. It beckoned to him. It defied
him. It led him wearily, doggedly on to new dangers
and disasters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>On the night in question, the four miles seemed
inconceivably long. The feet of his party dragged.
A moody silence hung about them. No one laughed.
Conversation had ceased. Behind him came the
monotonous crunch, crunch, crunch of scores of
snowshoes, beating out a path. Crunch, crunch,
crunch&mdash;tired, laggard feet moved hesitatingly,
moved fearfully, ready at the slightest pretext to turn
and flee.</p>
<p>Neither Dick nor his two chums believed that in
case of an attack, any of the Indians, comprising
their party, would make a stand. They were too
fearful. In the final crisis, so Dick believed, he
would be forced to depend solely upon his two
friends and himself. Yet in numbers there is
strength. Their imposing array would be sure to
impress the enemy.</p>
<p>They reached the village. They bore down upon
it, forty strong, shouting their defiance. With their
rifles ready, they entered the outskirts, laggard steps
becoming more laggard, frightened faces becoming
more frightened as the crisis approached. They
were offered no resistance. Could it be that the
village was asleep? A few huskies sniffed at their
heels. A papoose cried in one of the tepees they
passed. Still they went on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>In the brilliant star-sprinkled sky a few clouds
were visible. One particularly dark cloud passed
across the moon. Shadows fell athwart the tepees.
It was darker now. The forms of Dick&rsquo;s followers
became shrouded in gloom. Along the white snow
surface crept a huge dark stain, an immensity of
shadow that blotted the earth.</p>
<p>The tepees were black blotches now against a dark
background. Out of this obscurity, coming as unexpectedly
as a fire-siren, shrieking its warning,
there rose a blood-curdling, hideous yell. Dick literally
froze in his tracks. A cold sweat broke out
upon his face. He had scarcely the strength to stand
upon his tottering legs.</p>
<p>The yell was followed by the cracking of rifles,
the whining of bullets. Appalled, his men drew back.
For a brief moment they stood their ground, then
broke and fled in confusion. The retreat became
a rout. Panic spread, rifles were hurled to one side,
and a few minutes later Dick&rsquo;s valiant supporters disappeared
from view, swallowed up in the semi-darkness.</p>
<p>Dick saw the absolute futility of attempting anything
further that night. Moving more leisurely,
he and his two chums followed his defeated column.
Again the trail oppressed him. Hope had gone
glimmering. He had reached the end of the road.
He heard Sandy speaking in mournful tones:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess there isn&rsquo;t much we can do now.
It&rsquo;s all over. I wouldn&rsquo;t give one whoop for Dr.
Brady&rsquo;s chances now, or the priest&rsquo;s either. What
do you think about it, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once the young Indian was at a loss to know
what to say. He shook his head and walked on beside
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of it all,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Our luck has
deserted us. There used to be a time, Sandy, when
we could stumble through difficulties blindly. But
I&rsquo;m afraid that that time has passed. We&rsquo;re up
against a solid rock wall. We can&rsquo;t scale it. It&rsquo;s too
high for our puny strength. We&rsquo;re helpless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Sandy, almost reverently, &ldquo;Corporal
Rand came up here single-handed to accomplish
what we have failed to do with forty men.
Have you stopped to think about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but Corporal Rand is licked too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trail did that. I&rsquo;m willing to bet that if
Corporal Rand were here now, he&rsquo;d dare to go back
to that Indian village alone, and would probably be
successful too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I realize that. But how do they do it? It&rsquo;s a
thing I&rsquo;ve often wondered at.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain it myself,&rdquo; said Sandy, &ldquo;unless
it is the awe in which they are held. You see, Dick,
all the people who live in this north country know
what wonderful men they are, how brave and determined.
They&rsquo;re afraid of them. But it&rsquo;s something
more than fear. It goes deeper than that. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t tell you what it is. It isn&rsquo;t exactly
awe or reverence or fear. Perhaps it is a
mixture of all these things. I really can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;
They struggled on, soon reaching the village,
where they were met by Father Michaud, who was
now in charge of the mission. Father Michaud carried
a lantern. He was a much older man than
either of his two associates. He held the lantern
out before him, and as the boys came closer, peered
up anxiously in their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, monsieur, is it not terrible. Ees everyone
safe? Are there no dead? So terrible&mdash;so terrible!&rdquo;
he lamented. &ldquo;Even from here I hear those
awful shouts an&rsquo; ze sound of ze rifles. Did you
make a brave ree-sistance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could we?&rdquo; answered Sandy. &ldquo;Everybody
ran away. At the first sound of firing, our brave
little army vanished like a flock of frightened
sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you saw nothing of ze Father Bleriot an&rsquo;
ze good Dr. Brad-ee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. We saw nothing of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Et ees so terrible,&rdquo; wailed the priest &ldquo;Tomorrow
will you go again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to think that over,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;But
what is the use. If you can supply me with some
really brave and courageous men, I&rsquo;ll undertake to
bring the good father and Dr. Brady back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but my people, zey are so prostrate, so heavy
with grief. Ze spirit has gone out of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not surprised at that,&rdquo; said Sandy, a
little more charitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Et ees to be regretted zat ze policeman ees seeck.
He ees a wonderful man, zat Corporal Rand. Nothing
on earth can stop zat man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you,&rdquo; whispered Sandy, nudging
Dick&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;He knows it too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will monsieur do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, we&rsquo;ll have something to eat and a
few hours sleep. After that, we can make our plans.
To be perfectly frank, Father Michaud, I don&rsquo;t know
what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s shoulders seemed to droop as he made the
assertion. He was feeling the weight of his responsibilities,
had reached the point where it seemed impossible
to go on.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, there flashed through his
mind the grim figure of the Inspector of Police.
The steel-gray eyes were regarding him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t have implicit faith in you, I wouldn&rsquo;t
send you on this expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Implicit faith in him! Yet he wondered if Cameron,
knowing of the odds against them, would have
held out hope for their ultimate success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Et ees too bad zat Corporal Rand ees ill,&rdquo; Father
Michaud repeated. &ldquo;Zey would be afraid of him;
monsieur. Zey see ze mounted police an&rsquo; zey are
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Dick had an idea. He turned quickly
to the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Michaud, where is the man I captured
earlier in the night? Where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one of ze cabins. Zey have put a guard
over him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, will you lead me to that cabin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest nodded. He commenced hobbling down
the road. They followed him and turned into the
narrow street, with the row of cabins on either side.
They hurried on through the dim light of early morning,
presently drawing up before a low structure,
in front of which stood a native, a rifle clutched in
his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door,&rdquo; said Dick in Cree. &ldquo;I wish
to see the prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered the dark interior. The guard struck
a match and lit the tiny taper that had been placed on
the mantle above the fireplace.</p>
<p>In front of the fire, rolled in a blanket, which had
been provided him, lay Dick&rsquo;s former track-mate.
Toma aroused him by shaking his shoulders none
too gently, yanking him to an upright position. The
man daubed at his eyes, looking sleepily about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked Dick in Cree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tawanish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Tawanish, I&rsquo;m about to release you.
You can go back to your own people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, are you mad?&rdquo; suddenly interposed Sandy.
&ldquo;Have you taken leave of your senses? Do you
realize what you are saying? No, Dick, we will
hold him here as a hostage. They have Dr. Brady
and Father Bleriot. We have this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick turned almost angrily upon his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Sandy, don&rsquo;t interfere. I know what
I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned again to the Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tawanish, I am sending you back to your own
people. You can go free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very good of my brother,&rdquo; stammered the
Indian, blinking at his liberator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will carry a message to your people,&rdquo; Dick
went on. &ldquo;Do you understand that, Tawanish&mdash;carry
a message. You must remember what I say,
else it will go hard with you and them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the message?&rdquo; Tawanish asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell them,&rdquo; Dick replied, choosing his
words carefully,&rdquo;&mdash;you must tell them, Tawanish,
that the mounted police have arrived. Corporal
Rand is here. Tell them that they must release the
good father and the white medicine man. As soon
as you return and tell them this, they must release
these two men and give them a convoy back to this
village. Do you understand what I have told you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Indian. &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Corporal Rand,&rdquo; Dick resumed, &ldquo;is a terrible
man. He is one of the greatest among all of
the mounted police. If you do not comply with his
request, his vengeance will be sure and certain. Do
you follow me, Tawanish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand what you have said. It shall be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Know you then that
if the good father and the white doctor do not return
to us before the time of the noonday sun, Corporal
Rand will proceed to your village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Toma stared in open-mouthed amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad!&rdquo; sputtered Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will come with us, Tawanish, I will give
you back your gun. Then you can start at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They filed from the room. Outside Dick dismissed
the guard, then led the way to his own billet,
where he had left his captive&rsquo;s rifle. Extracting the
cartridges, he handed it over to Tawanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;and give your chief and your
people my message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian&rsquo;s departure was sudden and abrupt.
He streaked for the door. Father Michaud touched
Dick&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;zat you have not made a
serious meestake, monsieur. Do you think zey will
heed your request?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick sat down on the edge of his bunk, under the
accusing gaze of his two chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pent up rage and anger, which had been seething
within Sandy&rsquo;s breast, suddenly broke forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fool! You fool! Of all the unthinking,
crazy actions I&rsquo;ve ever witnessed, this is the worst.
Do you realize what you&rsquo;ve done? Do you know
what will happen now? Wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me,
would you? Nor Toma? Nor Father Michaud?
You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s tirade ended in a choking and sputtering
wholly unintelligible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t the sense to see it, so I&rsquo;ll tell you.
The Indians might hesitate about killing Dr. Brady
and Father Bleriot as long as we had one of their
own people here. They&rsquo;d be afraid that if they did
commit such an act, we&rsquo;d retaliate by taking the life
of that Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, clearing his throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, by your colossal blunder, you have made
the way easy for them. They can kill them with perfect
impunity. Dick, how could you be so thoughtless.
Your plan won&rsquo;t work. You acted on impulse.
I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; more kindly, &ldquo;that if you&rsquo;d paused to
reason it all out in your mind, you&rsquo;d never have
taken that step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had nothing to say. It did seem as if Sandy
were right. It was an awful moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sandy, &ldquo;we might as well go to bed.
There is nothing more that we can do now. Come
on, Dick, let&rsquo;s tumble in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest turned away quietly and left the room.
They could hear the crunch of his footsteps outside.
Toma and Sandy sat down and commenced pulling
off their moccasins. But Dick did not stir. His
hopeless, tragic eyes stared into the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">WHEN MOMENTS ARE ETERNITY</span></h2>
<p>Sandy consulted his watch. His face was anxious.
Little worried lines showed under his eyes
and at the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s eleven o&rsquo;clock, Dick,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;One
hour to go. If they aren&rsquo;t here by twelve, they won&rsquo;t
come at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dick miserably. &ldquo;Eleven o&rsquo;clock.
But they may come, Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suspense was difficult to endure. In the last
half hour, Sandy&rsquo;s watch had been jerked from his
pocket no less than seven times. The three boys sat
in their billet and marked the slow passing of time.
All through the morning they had experienced a
nervous tension, which was becoming rapidly more
and more acute. Toma paced up and down the floor,
paying little heed to what his two chums said. Occasionally,
he looked out through one of the frosted
windows, straining his ears for the shout that would
announce the safe return of the two captives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>In his heart, Toma half-believed that Dick&rsquo;s plan
would work. He knew the awe and reverence in
which the mounted police were held. If Dr. Brady
and Father Bleriot were not sent back, it would be
because the Indians had come to the conclusion that
Dick&rsquo;s statement regarding Corporal Rand was
merely a bluff.</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s watch ticked off the seconds. Dick
stepped forward to stir up the fire. There came a
timid knock at the door.</p>
<p>It was Father Michaud. He shuffled through the
doorway, his robes rustling about him, his thin bare
hands rubbing each other to restore their sluggish
circulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, monsieurs,&rdquo; he broke forth, &ldquo;I have slept
but ill. Et ees most difficult theese slow waiting. Do
you not think, monsieurs? All night I worry veree
much. Zen I pray, monsieurs. Et ees a great help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy pulled forward a chair for their unhappy
visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit-down, father. Take a place here close to the
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Merci.</i> You are kind, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He half-turned in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think zey will come?&rdquo; he asked, addressing
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s face was tragic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid, father, they may not come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>For twenty minutes the priest kept alive a failing
conversation. Occasionally, Sandy consulted his
watch. Time slipped by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty minutes to twelve,&rdquo; said Sandy, at the
end of what seemed like an eternity.</p>
<p>Toma continued his pacing back and forth. Dick
sat huddled in his chair. The priest rambled on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes to twelve,&rdquo; Sandy informed them.</p>
<p>Dick could endure the suspense no longer. He
rose, crossed the room, and flung open the door. A
cold draft of air whirled in across the floor. Toma
hurried over to where Dick stood and peered over
his shoulder. They heard a shout. It brought
Sandy and Father Michaud to their feet. Villagers
were running in the street. A crowd had gathered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;ve come back,&rdquo; blurted Dick, darting
through the door, Toma right behind him. They
joined the throng.</p>
<p>In the center of the crowd stood, not Dr. Brady
and Father Bleriot, but&mdash;and Dick&rsquo;s heart sank at
the sight of him&mdash;their captive of the night before.
In his hand he waved something&mdash;something white.
With Toma acting as his interference, and employing
football tactics, Dick plunged through, gaining a
place by the side of the messenger. He seized the
piece of birch bark and scanned it eagerly. It was
covered thickly with Indian signs and symbols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma,&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;can you make this out?
Tell me, what does it say here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>Toma took the birch bark in his own trembling
hands, studied it for a moment, then in a fit of anger
threw it at his feet, where with one foot he trampled
it in the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it say?&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s voice was shrill,
plaintive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It say,&rdquo; stormed Toma, &ldquo;that you tell &rsquo;em big
lie about mounted police; that Corporal Rand no
come here at all. They make you big laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant Dick bethought him of the messenger.
Defy him, would they? Well, he&rsquo;d see
about that. At least, he&rsquo;d seize their messenger. He
sprang forward with this purpose in view, but the
Indian slipped under his arm, dodged behind the tall
figure of one of the gaping natives, and before anyone
could prevent it, had made his escape. At that
moment, Sandy came plowing through the ranks
of the spectators, shouting hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Dr. Brady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this rumpus about then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Indian prisoner I released last night came
back with a defiant message, which says that they,
the Indians, don&rsquo;t believe that the policeman is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the messenger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He slipped away from me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Dick ordered the crowd back with an authoritative
wave of his arm. His feeling of hopelessness and
despair had given place to anger, to a consuming,
burning rage. The Indians had defied him openly.
They were making a fool out of him. They had
called his bluff.</p>
<p>It occurred to him that he could recruit another
attacking party and go to the doctor&rsquo;s rescue. But
the memory of his experience of the night before
still rankled in his mind. No&mdash;if he were to accomplish
anything, it would be through his own efforts,
and with the assistance of only Sandy and Toma.
He beckoned to his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to the billet,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;and
talk this thing over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As his two friends came up, he linked his arms in
theirs and began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see now, Sandy, that I have made a terrible
mistake. I&rsquo;ve got myself in a hole and may
never be able to get out of it. Just the same, I don&rsquo;t
intend to give up. I&rsquo;m not licked yet. I want to
know if you boys will stand behind me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dick, we&rsquo;re with you,&rdquo; Sandy assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You depend on us,&rdquo; added Toma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>Back in the billet again, they commenced to lay
their plans. On the previous night they had tried,
by the superiority of their numbers, to intimidate the
enemy. They had failed. Now they would employ
stealth. That night, they decided, the three of them
would creep up to the Indian village and attempt a
rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may be successful,&rdquo; said Sandy. &ldquo;We have
a chance, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our last chance, too,&rdquo; declared Dick. &ldquo;If we fail
in this, it is all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later, Sandy went over to the mission store
to purchase a few supplies. Toma remained behind,
his head bowed deep in thought. Silence had come
to the room, broken only by the breathing of the
boys and the crackling of the logs in the fireplace.
After a time, Dick rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;d better be thinking about lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden, Toma darted to his feet. He had
sprung from his chair so quickly, that Dick, who was
looking at him, could scarcely follow the lightning
movement. Toma hugged himself in ecstacy. He
seized Dick in a smothering embrace, whirling him
around and around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, listen me,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I know what we
do now. I think it all out. It come to me in flash.
Sandy no need go at all. Jus&rsquo; you, me go. We
go this afternoon. Hurry&mdash;you follow me quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>Blindly Dick followed the other. He trotted down
the street in the wake of his excited chum, wondering
what it was all about. They hurried past the
mission school, reaching, finally, a low dwelling, into
which, without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, without even
the preliminary of a knock, Toma darted.</p>
<p>It was the house which harbored Corporal Rand.
Upon the afternoon of their arrival, the policeman
had been placed here with an Indian woman in attendance.
He was here now, sitting propped up in
a chair in front of a pleasant fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, corporal,&rdquo; both boys greeted
him.</p>
<p>The policeman turned his head. As he did so,
the boys stopped abruptly. A remarkable change
had taken place in him. His cheeks were fuller now.
His eyes burned less brightly. The heavy beard-growth
had been removed. He smiled a wan greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick and Toma, as I live! Where did you come
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a billet down the street,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes; and I have been ill. Very ill. I can
remember&mdash;it is so difficult to remember&mdash;but I was
on the trail, wasn&rsquo;t I? A difficult trail. And what
is the name of this place, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keechewan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keechewan! Keechewan!&rdquo; Corporal Rand repeated
the name. &ldquo;It sounds familiar, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>Toma was beside him now&mdash;standing very close,
looking down into the sick man&rsquo;s eyes. He suddenly
stooped and whispered something into Rand&rsquo;s willing
ears, then drew back smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; he announced to Dick, who had
come closer. &ldquo;Corporal Rand he say all right. Him
willing we go. We must hurry very fast, Dick.
You go back to billet an&rsquo; pretty soon I go there too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And almost before he realized it, Toma had seized
his arm and was dragging him toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;You go back to billet.
I know place where I find two horses. You get us
something to eat in plenty hurry. Two rifles, cartridge
belts, revolvers&mdash;&mdash;You work quick&mdash;plenty
fast. So me too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Toma,&rdquo; protested his bewildered companion,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see. I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&mdash;What&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No time ask &rsquo;em questions now. Do like I say.
Quick! Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the open doorway Dick was bundled,
pushed, treated somewhat roughly, considering that
Toma was his friend. Outside in the chill air, he had
started to protest again, but the door was slammed in
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be good fellow. Hurry now!&rdquo; the inexorable
voice boomed at him through the heavy barrier.
&ldquo;I be along mebbe eight, ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>There was nothing left for him to do except obey.
Shaking his head, wondering what new form of insanity
had seized hold of his friend, he wheeled about
and struck back towards the billet. There he gathered
up a bundle of food, secured the rifles, cartridges
and revolver&mdash;exactly as he had been instructed&mdash;and
sat down to wait.</p>
<p>In a remarkably short time Toma appeared. His
coming was heralded by the clatter of hooves. Dick
heard a voice calling to him.</p>
<p>Toma did not even dismount, as Dick thrust his
head through the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that my horse?&rdquo; asked Dick, feeling a little
foolish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your horse. Bring &rsquo;em rifles an&rsquo; grub an&rsquo; jump
up into saddle quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was just coming down the street, his arms
loaded with provisions, when the two horses, their
flanks quivering, nostrils dilated, leaped from the
trodden snow around the doorway and galloped away
like mad.</p>
<p>They turned off on the north trail, whirling past
an open-mouthed sentry, who, in his hurry to get
out of the way, stepped back in a huge snowdrift and
sat down. They streaked over a narrow bridge,
spanning a creek, shot up the steep embankment on
the farther side and, at break-neck speed, headed
for the open country in the direction of the Indian
village. It was not until they were two miles out,
that Toma drew in his horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;We stop here for a few minutes,&rdquo; he informed
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma produced a bulky package, deftly opened
and shook out&mdash;a frayed crimson tunic of the
mounted police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; Dick gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You put &rsquo;em on&mdash;quick! You Corporal Rand
now. Indians be much afraid when we ride up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trembling, Dick removed his own coat and put
on the crimson garment. They rode on again.</p>
<p>It was all that Dick could do to sit erect in his
saddle, much less simulate a quiet determination, a
bravery he did not feel. The two miles dwindled
into one. The remaining mile to the village&mdash;how
quickly did it seem to slip away past them, bringing
them closer and closer to that unwavering row
of brown tepees.</p>
<p>Their horses went forward at a walk. From the
tiny dwellings emerged human figures. Malevolent
eyes were watching them. Dick caught the flash of
sunlight on some bright object, probably a rifle barrel,
and he grew rigid in the saddle, instinctively
reaching toward the holster at his side. Toma detected
the motion and soberly shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;No do that,&rdquo; he advised promptly. &ldquo;Mounted
police never pull gun &rsquo;til other fellow get ready to
use his. What you say we make horses go fast?
Gallop right up to village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick approved the suggestion. For one thing, a
flying mark is more difficult to hit. Another thing,
it gave a touch of realism to their bluff. It was
exactly what a mounted policeman would do.</p>
<p>So, when less than fifty yards from the nearest
tepee, they dug their heels into their ponies&rsquo; flanks
and cantered briskly up. They approached the first
two tepees and passed them without mishap. But
Dick&rsquo;s heart was in his throat now. His cheeks
were drained of color. With increasing difficulty, he
kept his place astride his plunging horse.</p>
<p>Indians were pouring out of their domiciles, like
disturbed bees from a hive. A low murmur came
to the boys&rsquo; ears. Form after form they flashed by,
scarcely conscious of where they were going until,
by chance, they perceived that toward the center of
the encampment there had gathered an excited crowd
of natives, who were watching their approach. Toward
this crowd, they made their way at a quick
gallop.</p>
<p>Dick felt a little dazed as they came to a sudden
halt. The Indians had fallen back, yet did not disperse.
Deep silence greeted them. It was so deeply
and intensely quiet that Dick could almost believe
that the Indians were statues of stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>He tried to speak, but his tongue clove in his
mouth. Fear had settled upon him and he seemed
powerless to shake it off. At the crucial moment,
when everything depended upon his actions and deportment,
he was failing miserably. Fortunately,
he had the good sense to see this and tried desperately
to control himself. He sat up more rigidly in the
saddle, his mittened hands clenched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make &rsquo;em talk,&rdquo; whispered Toma.</p>
<p>Dick flung up one arm in a commanding gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the two white men here at once,&rdquo; he
ordered.</p>
<p>Then suddenly his gaze seemed to waver. The
crowd became a blur&mdash;a shadowy something before
his eyes. In their place rose up the stern figure of
Inspector Cameron&mdash;the worn, austere face, the
steel-gray eyes, the decisive chin. Again Dick threw
up his arm. A strange calmness pervaded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring them here,&rdquo; he repeated in a voice of gathering
impatience.</p>
<p>A murmur rose from the crowd. Suddenly it
fell back, hesitated for a brief interval, then hurried
away to do the white chief&rsquo;s bidding. The tension
had relaxed. As he slowly turned in his saddle
to meet the gaze of his friend, a ray of sunlight fell
across Toma&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-bye they come!&rdquo; he cried happily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">BACK AT THE MISSION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve won, Dick. Dr. Brady says that you
were absolutely wonderful. The way you sat on your
horse, the way you ordered that crowd of natives
about&mdash;your calmness, your courage. You were
every inch a policeman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Dr. Brady would say if he knew
the truth. I wonder what he would say if he knew
that I was quaking inside like a jelly-fish. It is true
that I sat on my horse, but the credit is due the
horse, not me. If he had moved as much as one
front leg, he&rsquo;d have shaken me out of the saddle.
Our cause would have been lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! Come! You&rsquo;re fooling, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. I was never more frightened in my
life, and I never want to be as badly frightened
again. I was trembling like a leaf. When the chief
brought out Father Bleriot and Dr. Brady and turned
them over to us, I very nearly collapsed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Indians were frightened too. They were
afraid of you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they were. Everyone was more or less
frightened, I guess, except Toma. Cool! Honestly
I think he enjoyed it. He egged me on, encouraged
me. I never would have had the nerve to enter that
village if it hadn&rsquo;t been for him. There&rsquo;s a young
man, Sandy, who was born without fear. He doesn&rsquo;t
know what it means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy rose and threw another log on the fire.
Then he rubbed the palms of his hands together and
grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll grant that. He doesn&rsquo;t. He loves action
and excitement. He eats it. I suppose he&rsquo;s off
somewhere now, worrying because we haven&rsquo;t much
left here to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where he is,&rdquo; laughed Dick. &ldquo;He went
back to the Indian village with Dr. Brady. Brady
is finishing his work there this afternoon. Toma
is his interpreter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment of silence. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, were you over to see Corporal Rand this
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much better. I never saw anyone improve so
rapidly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t talk with Dr. Brady. Did he tell
you, Dick&mdash;did you hear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>In his excitement, Sandy pulled forward a chair
and plumped himself into it, putting both hands on
Dick&rsquo;s knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Brady admits that he was wrong. His first
examination was&mdash;er&mdash;well, a little hasty. Those
feet, for example. Bad, of course, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me he&rsquo;ll walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will be well enough to return to his duties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Brady believes so now. He was quite enthusiastic
this morning. It&rsquo;ll take months, of course&mdash;months
before he&rsquo;ll be around again. First, he
must go to Edmonton and have an operation&mdash;skin
grafting and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his mind is all right too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Almost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost!&rdquo; snorted Dick. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that,
surely. Why, he was perfectly rational last night,
when I had a talk with him. He remembered everything.
He told me about his troubles on the trail.
He asked me if we were intending to take the Keechewan
mail back with us. We had a long talk together.
His mind is as bright as a new silver American
dollar. What made you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy rose again and pushed back his chair. He
walked over and stood with his back to the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting colder, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, you gay young deceiver, you didn&rsquo;t
answer my question.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Sandy looked up blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, what? Question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. My question. Why do you think that
Corporal Rand hasn&rsquo;t fully recovered his mental
powers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t&mdash;quite,&rdquo; Sandy wagged his head dolefully.
&ldquo;He sometimes suffers from hallucinations.
Dr. Brady and I both noticed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was one in particular. It would have
amused me, only I feel so sorry for him. He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s&mdash;well,
he thinks he&rsquo;s going to be placed under
arrest. Can you imagine anything so absurd? And
by Inspector Cameron, too. He&rsquo;s really worrying
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s roar of laughter echoed to every part of
the room. Tears of merriment chased each other
down his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that is so very funny,&rdquo; Sandy declared
with great dignity. &ldquo;You ought to pity the
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You chump! You chump!&rdquo; howled Dick. &ldquo;Why
that&mdash;that isn&rsquo;t an hallucination; it&rsquo;s a fact. Corporal
Rand may be arrested. He probably will be,
but I don&rsquo;t believe Cameron will be very severe with
him. Not this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he done?&rdquo; blinked Sandy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;Disobeyed orders. He came up here against the
inspector&rsquo;s wishes. You see, Cameron intended to
come himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Sandy, much relieved, &ldquo;the inspector
has probably forgotten all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he! Cameron never forgets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t be hard on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. He&rsquo;ll impose a light fine along
with a severe lecture. Then he&rsquo;ll reach in his pocket
and give Rand the money to pay the fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell Rand that? I think it will
relieve his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I will.&rdquo; Dick rose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a run over
there now and cheer him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had readied the door, when Sandy called
him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sandy, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember the night when you released the Indian&mdash;sent
him back to his people with that message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I called you some names, Dick. I&rsquo;m sorry
about that. I guess I was a bit angry and overbearing.
You&rsquo;ll overlook it, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick took his chum&rsquo;s hand and gripped it firmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I&rsquo;d forgotten about it. Anyway, it&rsquo;s all
right. Everything is all right,&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re all right, too,&rdquo; declared Sandy.</p>
<p>Which, considering everything, was as fine a compliment
as Dick had ever received.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">A TREK HOMEWARD</span></h2>
<p>A dog train waited outside the Keechewan Mission.
It was a long train&mdash;ten teams of malemutes
and huskies&mdash;an impatient train, too, for not only
the dogs but the drivers as well, waited impatiently
for the word of command that would set it in motion.
Brake-boards were passed firmly into the snow,
the feet holding them in place becoming cramped
as the moments passed and still the leader did not
appear.</p>
<p>Presently a door creaked open and a tall young
man, laden with two heavy mail sacks, emerged to
the street. It was Dick Kent&mdash;and he was smiling.
Behind Dick came Dr. Brady and the cassocked figure
of a Catholic priest, Father Bleriot. The two
last named persons walked side-by-side, talking and
laughing. The priest&rsquo;s right arm was thrust in
friendly fashion through that of the physician&rsquo;s, and,
as the three figures came to a halt directly opposite
the sledge, to which a team of beautiful gray malemutes
were harnessed, the doctor declared:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re to go back at last. I see you have
everything ready, Dick. Nothing to do now except
pull our worthless freight out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur does himself an injustice,&rdquo; beamed the
priest. &ldquo;You have reason to feel proud&mdash;you and
your friends. Hope and happiness and tranquility
have come again to Keechewan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any message that I can take to Inspector
Cameron?&rdquo; Dick asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is there in the sack,&rdquo; Father Bleriot pointed
to one of the mail pouches Dick had placed in the
empty sleigh. &ldquo;A letter, monsieur, written from
my heart and sealed with tears of thankfulness. All
one night I sat and wrote that letter, page after page,
to the good inspector, and when I had finished, monsieur,
I found that I had expressed not even one small
part of what I wished to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cameron will understand,&rdquo; Dr. Brady reassured
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you go,&rdquo; said the priest regretfully.
&ldquo;You embark upon a difficult journey. You go
south without even a pause to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not seem so far this time,&rdquo; stated Dick,
turning toward his sledge. &ldquo;Well, thank you
Father, for your kindness and hospitality. We must
go now. Dr. Brady, you&rsquo;ve worked hard, so we&rsquo;re
giving you the place of honor here with the mail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>They shook hands again. Dr. Brady was bundled
into the sleigh. At a signal from Dick, impatient
feet were lifted from brake-boards, whips
cracked, and the train whirled away amid a flurry of
fine snow. Father Bleriot, a somewhat lonely figure,
stood and waved his farewell, his expressive dark
eyes lighting with satisfaction, as there came to
him the cheers of scores of happy householders, who
lined the streets to watch the party go by.</p>
<p>Speeding southward, the dog train soon left the
village behind. The bleak landscape of the Barrens
settled around them. Rolling drifts of crusted snow
stretched away to the horizon. The wind shrieked
up from behind, a cold wind which froze the hot
breath of the huskies, and painted their lean, gray
flanks with a white coat of frost.</p>
<p>Hour after hour, then day after day, the cavalcade
bore on. The Barrens vanished. A streak of
dun-colored forest slowly advanced and silently enwrapped
them. The forest led them to a chain of
hills. The hills carried them begrudgingly to a valley.
The valley flung them into a meadow, which, in turn,
by various stages, brought them to another forest,
another valley, across lakes, down ravines, over
rivers, on and on and on, until at last, when they had
almost begun to believe that the trail would never
end, weary yet exuberant, they drove into the compound
at Fort Mackenzie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>There followed a scene which to Dick at least
seemed somewhat confused and vague. He remembered
helping to carry Corporal Rand into the barracks.
He recalled a good deal of shouting and
laughing. A throng pressed forward, sledges were
unloaded, drivers darted here and there. Sandy
and Toma joined Dick, and they were standing there,
talking excitedly, when a crimson-coated figure
pushed his way through the crowd and approached
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome back,&rdquo; Constable Whitehall shouted.
&ldquo;Glad to see you all home again. The inspector is
waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three boys followed the police orderly to Cameron&rsquo;s
office, followed him in a state of mind in which
excitement, happiness and relief intermingled. They
had expected to find the grizzled police official sitting,
as was his wont, sternly erect in his chair, lips
pursed, steel-gray eyes levelled upon them. But to
their surprise, as the door swung open, revealing
the room beyond, the inspector was standing&mdash;not
behind&mdash;but in front of his desk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>The grim look was not there. True, his eyes were
upon them, and he did not speak for a moment, as
they filed in and halted awkwardly in front of him.
Then Dick noticed the smile: warm and friendly, a
sort of paternal smile that wholly transfigured and
enlivened his features, that had the curious effect of
making the boys forget their shyness and feel at
ease. And while Dick was making a mental note of
this, Cameron had suddenly come forward and was
shaking them by the hand, talking and joking, winking
slyly at Constable Whitehall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young rascals! No need to tell me that
everything didn&rsquo;t come out all right. Don&rsquo;t try to
deceive me. I see it&mdash;see it shining in your eyes.
Constable Whitehall, bring over those chairs. That&rsquo;s
better. Sit down. Now, Dick&mdash;&mdash; Sit down,
I tell you, while Richard here relates his experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few words, Dick told his story. Yet he was
out of breath when he had finished, and a little incoherent
when he tried to answer the few sharp
questions Cameron fired at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; smiled the inspector, &ldquo;you got
there, and you came back. From what you&rsquo;ve already
told me, I gather that you had trouble at
Keechewan. Was that the only trouble you had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the bewildered young leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dick,&rdquo; Sandy reminded him, &ldquo;we had
trouble on the trail&mdash;lots of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we did,&rdquo; remembered Dick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten
about that. We picked up Lamont on our way back,
but Fontaine and the rest left us&mdash;skipped out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; said Cameron grimly, &ldquo;&mdash;in
jail! We can eliminate them. Now, about this
Lamont?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shoot him,&rdquo; declared Toma briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo;&mdash;sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him bad fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cameron&rsquo;s mouth twitched at the corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he hurt badly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right in a few weeks, inspector,&rdquo; Dick
came quickly to his chum&rsquo;s rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Toma justified in doing this?&rdquo; Cameron
inquired, turning to Sandy and Dick.</p>
<p>Two young men quickly nodded their affirmation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all I want to know. I&rsquo;ll overlook
it this time, Toma. You&rsquo;ve already told me, Dick,
about Corporal Rand. Took him to the barracks,
you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Cameron rose from his chair and paced
slowly up and down the room. For a time he seemed
oblivious of their presence. He had become grim
and forbidding now, stern and austere&mdash;not at all
the companionable and affable person he had been at
the beginning of their interview. Dick and Sandy
exchanged questioning glances, then their eyes stole
furtively toward the door.</p>
<p>The footbeats came to a sudden pause in front
of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful to all of you&mdash;very grateful! I&rsquo;m
proud of you. Of course, I&rsquo;ll pay you well. You
deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cameron was smiling again. His voice had lost
its sharp edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if there is anything that I can do. If&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick interrupted him. It was the opportunity he
had been looking for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one favor, inspector,&rdquo; he cleared his
throat. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing we&rsquo;d like&mdash;Sandy and
Toma and I. You see, we&rsquo;ve talked it over. We don&rsquo;t
want the money. Money isn&rsquo;t everything. We were
glad to help out in an emergency. Glad&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; yes, my boy. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d be ever so much obliged to you, sir, and
thankful, if you&rsquo;d dismiss the charge against Corporal
Rand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Dick had hurled a bomb under Cameron&rsquo;s desk
it could not have caused more consternation and surprise.
Whitehall started back and his mouth gaped
open. Inspector Cameron blinked, gulped several
times, and attempted to cover his confusion by blowing
his nose. A deep and oppressive silence settled
over the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>Not until then, did Dick realize that he had committed
an unpardonable breach of official etiquette.
He had smashed precedent and dignity to bits. He
had violated the code. He had taken advantage of
his position. As the full consciousness of the enormity
of his crime came over him, he hung his head,
his cheeks flaming to match the color of the inspector&rsquo;s
tunic.</p>
<p>Suddenly the tension snapped. Inspector Cameron
broke into a roar of laughter. He slapped his thighs
and still choking with merriment, turned to his orderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whitehall, you&mdash;you see how helpless I am. I
ask you to become my witness. I&rsquo;m powerless. This
is blackmail. Conduct these young ruffians outside.
And, Whitehall&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he paused abruptly.</p>
<p>The constable&rsquo;s heels clicked as he came sharply to
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Corporal Rand that I&rsquo;ll see him at once.&rdquo;</p>

  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<p class="pg">1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p class="pg">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p class="pg">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p class="pg">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="pg">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p class="pg">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p class="pg">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p class="pg">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p class="pg">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
